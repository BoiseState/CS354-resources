# Simple Server

This webserver uses a popular framework called Express to do webserver things.

This website is capable of hosting static files currently. 
You can continue to work with it in this fashion, or you can 
choose to extend it in a way that provides a more complex user experience for 
your website (for example, with a templating engine). 

Extending it is not required, although you will want the website
to look nice in the demonstration.

## Getting Started

Copy these files into your team repository and begin adding content to it.

I’d recommend starting by going through the source of the website,
looking for references to names that you can change to your team name.
Also see how it is set up to serve routes with data "from the backend" 
and to see where the website "stuff" lives.

## Running the Website

To run the website, make sure you have NodeJS installed.

Install the dependencies by running the npm command that was installed when you installed NodeJS.

    npm install

If everything completes successfully, you can run with the following command:

    DEBUG=<project-name>:* npm start

Continue exploring if you’d like to see how it all works.

## Developing the Website

Adding HTML pages that are served by the webserver is the simplest way to get started.
Then, add content to those pages that reflect the desired structure of your website.
