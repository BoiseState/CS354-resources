# Interpreter Assignment

## Overview

Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple of
sentences, you're going too far. Generally you should be pulling this
right from the project specification. I don't want you to just cut and
paste, but paraphrase what is stated in the project specification.

## Reflection

### Part 1: Lexical Analysis

This assignment features multiple parts. 
Write a two paragraph reflection describing your experience with this
part.  Talk about what worked well and what was challenging.  
Did you run into an issue that took some time to figure out?  
Tell us about it. What did you enjoy, what was less desirable? Feel
free to add other items (within the two paragraph limit).

## Results

This section presents timing and other results of any experiments that
you were asked to perform as part of the project.

### Part 1: Lexical Analysis

## Sources used

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files,
or text book you need to list them here. If you looked something up on
stackoverflow.com and fail to cite it in this section it will be
considered plagiarism and be dealt with accordingly. So be safe CITE!

Finally, remove these instructions from your README.md after you are finished!
