abstract = {Humans employ different information channels (modalities) such as speech, pictures and gestures in their commu-nication. It is believed that some of these modalities are more error-prone to some specific type of data and therefore multimodality can help to reduce ambiguities in the interaction. There have been numerous efforts in implementing multimodal interfaces for computers and robots. Yet, there is no general standard framework for developing them. In this paper we propose a general framework for implementing multimodal interfaces. It is designed to perform natural language understanding, multi-modal integration and semantic analysis with an incremental pipeline and includes a multimodal grammar language, which is used for multimodal presentation and semantic meaning generation.},

abstract = {Affective computing is an emerging interdisciplinary research field bringing together researchers and practitioners from various fields, ranging from artificial intelligence, natural language processing, to cognitive and social sciences. With the proliferation of videos posted online (e.g., on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for product reviews, movie reviews, political views, and more, affective computing research has increasingly evolved from conventional unimodal analysis to more complex forms of multimodal analysis. This is the primary motivation behind our first of its kind, comprehensive literature review of the diverse field of affective computing. Furthermore, existing literature surveys lack a detailed discussion of state of the art in multimodal affect analysis frameworks, which this review aims to address. Multimodality is defined by the presence of more than one modality or channel, e.g., visual, audio, text, gestures, and eye gage. In this paper, we focus mainly on the use of audio, visual and text information for multimodal affect analysis, since around 90{\%} of the relevant literature appears to cover these three modalities. Following an overview of different techniques for unimodal affect analysis, we outline existing methods for fusing information from different modalities. As part of this review, we carry out an extensive study of different categories of state-of-the-art fusion techniques, followed by a critical analysis of potential performance improvements with multimodal analysis compared to unimodal analysis. A comprehensive overview of these two complementary fields aims to form the building blocks for readers, to better understand this challenging and exciting research field.},

We evaluate the proposed approach on the second Dia-log State Tracking Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset. The corpus has been converted for the occasion in order to frame the hid-den state variable inference as a question-answering task based on a sequence of ut-terances extracted from a dialog. We show that the proposed tracker gives encourag-ing results. Then, we propose to extend the DSTC-2 dataset and the definition of this dialog state task with specific reason-ing capabilities like counting, list mainte-nance, yes-no question answering and in-definite knowledge management.

abstract = {Important advances have recently been made using computational semantic models to de-code brain activity patterns associated with concepts; however, this work has almost ex-clusively focused on concrete nouns. How well these models extend to decoding abstract nouns is largely unknown. We address this question by applying state-of-the-art compu-tational models to decode functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) activity patterns, elicited by participants reading and imagin-ing a diverse set of both concrete and abstract nouns. One of the models we use is linguistic, exploiting the recent word2vec skipgram ap-proach trained on Wikipedia. The second is visually grounded, using deep convolutional neural networks trained on Google Images. Dual coding theory considers concrete con-cepts to be encoded in the brain both linguisti-cally and visually, and abstract concepts only linguistically. Splitting the fMRI data accord-ing to human concreteness ratings, we indeed observe that both models significantly decode the most concrete nouns; however, accuracy is significantly greater using the text-based mod-els for the most abstract nouns. More gener-ally this confirms that current computational models are sufficiently advanced to assist in investigating the representational structure of abstract concepts in the brain.},

Using linguistic context and visual features, our method is able to efficiently hypothesize the semantic meaning of new words and add them to its word dictionary so that they can be used to describe images which contain these novel concepts. Our method has an image captioning module based on m-RNN with several improvements. In particular, we propose a transposed weight sharing scheme, which not only improves performance on image captioning, but also makes the model more suitable for the novel concept learning task. We propose methods to prevent overfitting the new concepts. In addition, three novel concept datasets are constructed for this new task. In the experiments, we show that our method effectively learns novel visual concepts from a few examples without disturbing the previously learned concepts.},

These results are then reasoned over in a hierarchical recurrent sequence model to generate answers. The DMN can be trained end-to-end and obtains state of the art results on several types of tasks and datasets: question answering (Facebook's bAbI dataset), sequence modeling for part of speech tagging (WSJ-PTB), coreference resolution (Quizbowl dataset) and text classification for sentiment analysis (Stanford Sentiment Treebank).

We observe that pragmatic reasoning helps primarily in the hardest cases: when the model must distinguish very similar colors, or when few utterances adequately express the target color. Our findings make use of a newly-collected corpus of human utterances in color reference games, which exhibit a variety of pragmatic behaviors.

abstract = {The present research sought to identify linguistic markers of sensitive self-disclosure in Twitter for three main purposes: (1) to support the development of software tools that can identify text as sensitive disclosure or not, (2) to contribute to the literature by establishing what is considered more sensitive disclosure in a specific CMC environment, and (3) to contribute to the methodological toolkit for studying sensitive self-disclosure. Two corpora were used in the present research. In Study 1 short messages were collected from Twitter and the site 'Secret Tweet' for comparison. In Study 2 'tweets' were collected and rated on sensitivity by six raters. LIWC and regression analyses were used to identify the linguistic markers of secret tweets (Study 1, 16 markers found) and sensitive self-disclosure (Study 2, 10 markers found). A software tool is developed to illustrate the markers in application. Implications for self-disclosure research, users, design and researchers are discussed.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the relative impacts of perceived cost, perceived benefits, and social influence on self-disclosure behaviors in social networking sites under an integrated theoretical framework. Design/methodology/approach – Building upon social exchange theory and privacy calculus theory, an integrated model was developed. The model was tested empirically using a sample of 405 social networking site's users. Users were required to complete a survey regarding self-disclosure behaviors in Facebook. Findings – The results indicate that social influence is the factor which exhibits the strongest effect on self-disclosure in social networking sites, followed by perceived benefits. Surprisingly, perceived privacy risk does not have any significant impact on self-disclosure. Research limitations/implications – The results inform researchers about the importance to incorporate social influence factors and cultural factors into future online self-disclosure study. Practical implications – The results suggest that users focus on the benefits as well as social influence when they decide to reveal personal information in social networking sites, but pay less attention to the potential privacy risks. Educators are advised to launch educational programs to raise students' awareness to the potential risks of self-disclosure in social networking sites. Service providers of social networking sites are encouraged to provide intuitive privacy indices showing users the levels of privacy protection. Originality/value – This paper is one of the first to develop and empirically tests an integrated model of self-disclosure in social networking sites. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In our experiments, we evaluate how the performance of the learner varies depending on the RL algorithm used and the number of traders. Our results show that (1) even in simple multi-party trad-ing dialog tasks, learning an effective ne-gotiation policy is a very hard problem; and (2) the use of neural fitted Q itera-tion combined with an incremental reward function produces negotiation policies as effective or even better than the policies of two strong hand-crafted baselines.},

@article{Lampert2009,
abstract = {We study the problem of object classification when training and test classes are disjoint, i.e. no training examples of the target classes are available. This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, ldquoAnimals with Attributesrdquo, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes.},

However, distant supervision inevitably accompanies with the wrong labelling problem, and these noisy data will substantially hurt the performance of relation extraction. To alleviate this issue, we propose a sentence-level attention-based model for relation extraction. In this model, we employ convolutional neural networks to embed the semantics of sentences. Afterwards, we build sentence-level attention over multiple instances, which is expected to dynamically reduce the weights of those noisy instances. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, our model can make full use of all informative sentences and effectively reduce the influence of wrong labelled instances.

abstract = {How universal is human conceptual structure? The way concepts are organized in the human brain may reflect distinct features of cultural, historical, and environmental background in addition to properties universal to human cognition. Semantics, or meaning expressed through language, provides direct access to the underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously difficult to measure, let alone parameterize. Here we provide an empirical measure of semantic proximity between concepts using cross-linguistic dictionaries. Across languages carefully selected from a phylogenetically and geographically stratified sample of genera, translations of words reveal cases where a particular language uses a single polysemous word to express concepts represented by distinct words in another. We use the frequency of polysemies linking two concepts as a measure of their semantic proximity, and represent the pattern of such linkages by a weighted network. This network is highly uneven and fragmented: certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than others, and there emerge naturally interpretable clusters loosely connected to each other. Statistical analysis shows such structural properties are consistent across different language groups, largely independent of geography, environment, and literacy. It is therefore possible to conclude the conceptual structure connecting basic vocabulary studied is primarily due to universal features of human cognition and language use.},

In a slot - filling dialogue , the semantic decoder predicts the dialogue act and a set of slot - value pairs from a set of n - best hypotheses returned by the Auto - matic Speech Recognition . Most current models for spoken language understanding assume (i) word - aligned semantic annotations as in sequence taggers and (ii) delexicalisation , or a mapping of input words to domain - specific concepts using heuristics that try to capture morphological variation but that do not scale to other domains nor to language variation (e . g . , morphology , syn - onyms , paraphrasing) . In this work the semantic decoder is trained using unaligned semantic annotations and it uses distributed semantic representation learning to overcome the limitations of explicit delexicalisation . The proposed architecture uses a convolutional neural network for the sentence representation and a long - short term memory network for the context representa - tion . Results are presented for the publicly available DSTC2 corpus and an In - car corpus which is similar to DSTC2 but has a significantly higher word error rate (WER) .},

It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates slightly better performance than RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a study where a robot instructs a human on how to draw a route on a map. The human and robot are seated face-to-face with the map placed on the table between them. The user's and the robot's gaze can thus serve several simultaneous functions: as cues to joint attention, turn-taking, level of understanding and task progression. We have compared this face-to-face setting with a setting where the robot employs a random gaze behaviour, as well as a voice-only setting where the robot is hidden behind a paper board. In addition to this, we have also manipulated turn-taking cues such as completeness and filled pauses in the robot's speech. By analysing the participants' subjective rating, task completion, verbal responses, gaze behaviour, and drawing activity, we show that the users indeed benefit from the robot's gaze when talking about landmarks, and that the robot's verbal and gaze behaviour has a strong effect on the users' turn-taking behaviour. We also present an analysis of the users' gaze and lexical and prosodic realisation of feedback after the robot instructions, and show that these cues reveal whether the user has yet executed the previous instruction, as well as the user's level of uncertainty. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In our system, each gesture is decomposed into large-scale body motion and local subtle movements such as hand articulation. The idea of learning at multiple scales is also applied to the temporal dimension, such that a gesture is considered as a set of characteristic motion impulses, or dynamic poses. Each modality is first processed separately in short spatio-temporal blocks, where discriminative data-specific features are either manually extracted or learned. Finally, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network for modeling large-scale temporal dependencies, data fusion and ultimately gesture classification. Our experiments on the 2013 Challenge on Multimodal Gesture Recognition dataset have demonstrated that using multiple modalities at several spatial and temporal scales leads to a significant increase in performance allowing the model to compensate for errors of individual classifiers as well as noise in the separate channels. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) has been proposed as a dialog model that enables automatic optimization of the dialog policy and provides robustness to speech understanding errors. Various approximations allow such a model to be used for building real-world dialog systems. However, they require a large number of dialogs to train the dialog policy and hence they typically rely on the availability of a user simulator. They also require significant designer effort to hand-craft the policy representation. We investigate the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) in policy modeling to overcome these problems. We show that GP policy optimization can be implemented for a real world POMDP dialog manager, and in particular: 1) we examine different formulations of a GP policy to minimize variability in the learning process; 2) we find that the use of GP increases the learning rate by an order of magnitude thereby allowing learning by direct interaction with human users; and 3) we demonstrate that designer effort can be substantially reduced by basing the policy directly on the full belief space thereby avoiding ad hoc feature space modeling. Overall, the GP approach represents an important step forward towards fully automatic dialog policy optimization in real world systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Alongside formal definitions, the authors use step-by-step derivations and detailed lexical definitions to illustrate this new form of syntactic analysis and to show how the model can be applied to a broad range of languages. In this way, the reader gets a sense of the rich potential the framework provides for general application to linguistic analysis. In bringing together explanations of knowledge of language, and the way language is used in parsing, the book challenges basic assumptions of linguistic theory, and is an essential read for anyone interested in what it means to know a language.},

Language, 82(3):515-535], that participants in conversation rely mainly on lexico-syntactic information when timing and producing their turns, and that they do not need to make use of intonational cues to achieve smooth transitions and avoid overlaps. In contrast to this view, but in line with previous observational studies, our results from a dialogue task and a button-press task involving questions and answers indicate that the identification of the end of intonational phrases is necessary for smooth turn-taking. In both tasks, participants never responded to questions (i.e., gave an answer or pressed a button to indicate a turn end) at turn-internal points of syntactic completion in the absence of an intonational phrase boundary. Moreover, in the button-press task, they often pressed the button at the same point of syntactic completion when the final word of an intonational phrase was cross-spliced at that location. Furthermore, truncated stimuli ending in a syntactic completion point but lacking an intonational phrase boundary led to significantly delayed button presses. In light of these results, we argue that earlier claims that intonation is not necessary for correct turn-end projection are misguided, and that research on turn-taking should continue to consider intonation as a source of turn-end cues along with other linguistic and communicative phenomena.},

abstract = {This paper investigates prosodic aspects of turn-taking in conversation with a view to improving the efficiency of identifying relevant places at which a machine can legitimately begin to talk to a human interlocutor. It examines the relationship between interaction control, the communicative function of which is to regulate the flow of information between interlocutors, and its phonetic manifestation. Specifically, the listener's perception of such interaction control phenomena is modelled. Algorithms for automatic online extraction of prosodic phenomena liable to be relevant for interaction control, such as silent pauses and intonation patterns, are presented and evaluated in experiments using Swedish map task data. We show that the automatically extracted prosodic features can be used to avoid many of the places where current dialogue systems run the risk of interrupt-ing their users, as well as to identify suitable places to take the turn.},

abstract = {When humans speak, they do not plan their full utterance in all detail before beginning to speak, nor do they speak piece-by-piece and ignoring their full message - instead humans use partial representations in which they fill in the missing parts as the utterance unfolds. Incremental speech synthesizers, in contrast, have not yet made use of partial representations and the information contained there-in. We analyze the quality of prosodic parameter assignments (pitch and duration) generated from partial utterance specifications (substituting defaults for missing features) in order to determine the requirements that symbolic incremental prosody modelling should meet. We find that broader, higher-level information helps to improve prosody even if lower-level information about the near future is yet unavailable. Furthermore, we find that symbolic phrase-level or utterance-level information is most helpful towards the end of the phrase or utterance, respectively, that is, when this information is becoming available even in the incremental case. Thus, the negative impact of incremental processing can be minimized by using partial representations that are filled in incrementally.},

abstract = {This paper explores durational aspects of pauses, gaps and overlaps in three different conversational corpora with a view to challenge claims about precision timing in turn-taking. Distributions of pause, gap and overlap durations in conversations are presented, and methodological issues regarding the statistical treatment of such distributions are discussed. The results are related to published minimal response times for spoken utterances and thresholds for detection of acoustic silences in speech. It is shown that turn-taking is generally less precise than is often claimed by researchers in the field of conversation analysis or interactional linguistics. These results are discussed in the light of their implications for models of timing in turn-taking, and for interaction control models in speech technology. In particular, it is argued that the proportion of speaker changes that could potentially be triggered by information immediately preceding the speaker change is large enough for reactive interaction controls models to be viable in speech technology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{DeRuiter2006,
abstract = {A key mechanism in the organization of turns at talk in conversation is the ability to anticipate or PROJECT the moment of completion of a current speaker's turn. Some authors suggest that this is achieved via lexicosyntactic cues, while others argue that projection is based on intonational contours. We tested these hypotheses in an on-line experiment, manipulating the presence of symbolic (lexicosyntactic) content and intonational contour of utterances recorded in natural con- versations. When hearing the original recordings, subjects can anticipate turn endings with the same degree of accuracy attested in real conversation. With intonational contour entirely removed (leaving intact words and syntax, with a completely flat pitch), there is no change in subjects' accuracy of end-of-turn projection. But in the opposite case (with original intonational contour intact, but with no recognizable words), subjects' performance deteriorates significantly. These results establish that the symbolic (i.e. lexicosyntactic) content of an utterance is necessary (and possibly sufficient) for projecting the moment of its completion, and thus for regulating conversa- tional turn-taking. By contrast, and perhaps surprisingly, intonational contour is neither necessary nor sufficient for end-of-turn projection.*},

abstract = {This paper investigates some conditions under which polarized user appraisals gathered throughout the course of a vocal interaction between a machine and a human can be integrated in a reinforcement learning-based dialogue manager. More specifically, we discuss how this information can be cast into socially-inspired rewards for speeding up the policy optimisation for both efficient task completion and user adaptation in an online learning setting. For this purpose a potential-based reward shaping method is combined with a sample efficient reinforcement learning algorithm to offer a principled framework to cope with these potentially noisy interim rewards. The proposed scheme will greatly facilitate the system's development by allowing the designer to teach his system through explicit positive/negative feedbacks given as hints about task progress, in the early stage of training. At a later stage, the approach will be used as a way to ease the adaptation of the dialogue policy to specific user profiles. Experiments carried out using a state-of-the-art goal-oriented dialogue management framework, the Hidden Information State (HIS), support our claims in two configurations: firstly, with a user simulator in the tourist information domain (and thus simulated appraisals), and secondly, in the context of man-robot dialogue with real user trials.},

@article{Grosz1986,
abstract = {In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse. In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interre- lated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a struc- ture of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the attentional state). The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utter- ances naturally aggregate. The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes, expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them. The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds. The attentional state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions. The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses. Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored. This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse. Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and track- ing the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state. This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants' knowledge of the domain.},

abstract = {In recent years extracting relevant infor-mation from biomedical and clinical texts such as research articles, discharge sum-maries, or electronic health records have been a subject of many research efforts and shared challenges. Relation extrac-tion is the process of detecting and classi-fying the semantic relation among entities in a given piece of texts. Existing models for this task in biomedical domain use ei-ther manually engineered features or ker-nel methods to create feature vector. These features are then fed to classifier for the prediction of the correct class. It turns out that the results of these methods are highly dependent on quality of user de-signed features and also suffer from curse of dimensionality. In this work we focus on extracting relations from clinical dis-charge summaries. Our main objective is to exploit the power of convolution neu-ral network (CNN) to learn features auto-matically and thus reduce the dependency on manual feature engineering. We eval-uate performance of the proposed model on i2b2-2010 clinical relation extraction challenge dataset. Our results indicate that convolution neural network can be a good model for relation exaction in clin-ical text without being dependent on ex-pert's knowledge on defining quality fea-tures.},

The key idea is that com- positionality is modeled as a multi-way interac- tion between latent factors, which are automat- ically constructed from corpus data. We use our method to model the composition of sub- ject verb object triples. The method consists of two steps. First, we compute a latent factor model for nouns from standard co-occurrence data. Next, the latent factors are used to induce a latent model of three-way subject verb object interactions. Our model has been evaluated on a similarity task for transitive phrases, in which it exceeds the state of the art. 1},

abstract = {I had intended this review not specifically as a criticism of Skinner's speculations regarding language, but rather as a more general critique of behaviorist (I would now prefer to say "empiricist") speculation as to the nature of higher mental processes. My reason for discussing Skinner's book in such detail was that it was the most careful and thoroughgoing presentation of such speculations, an evaluation that I feel is still accurate. Therefore, if the conclusions I attempted to substantiate in the review are correct, as I believe they are, then Skinner's work can be regarded as, in effect, a reductio ad absurdum of behaviorist assumptions. My personal view is that it is a definite merit, not a defect, of Skinner's work that it can be used for this purpose, and it was for this reason that I tried to deal with it fairly exhaustively. I do not see how his proposals can be improved upon, aside from occasional details and oversights, within the framework of the general assumptions that he accepts. I do not, in other words, see any way in which his proposals can be substantially improved within the general framework of behaviorist or neobehaviorist, or, more generally, empiricist ideas that has dominated much of modern linguistics, psychology, and philosophy. The conclusion that I hoped to establish in the review, by discussing these speculations in their most explicit and detailed form, was that the general point of view was largely mythology, and that its widespread acceptance is not the result of empirical support, persuasive reasoning, or the absence of a plausible alternative.},

abstract = {This paper views lexical acquisition as a problem of induction: Children must figure out the meaning of a given term, given the large number of possible meanings any term could have. If children had to consider, evaluate, and rule out unlimited number of hypotheses about each word in order to figure out its meaning, learning word meanings would be hopeless. Children must, therefore, be limited in the kinds of hypotheses they consider as possible word meanings. This paper considers three possible constraints on word meanings: (1) The whole object assumption which leads children to interpret novel terms as labels for objects-not parts, substances, or other properties of objects; (2) The taxonomic assumption which leads children to consider labels as referring to objects of like kind, rather than to objects that are thematically related; and (3) The mutual exclusivity assumption which leads children to expect each object to have only one label. Some of the evidence for these constraints is reviewed. ?? 1990.},

Our approach is based around the fundamental technique of building lexicons of perceptual "simulators" which link noisy sensory experiences to internal symbolic representations. These sensory representations are paired with a basic model of association, allowing for the grounding of linguistic symbols directly in action knowledge - a grounding which is then exploited to bootstrap the development of more advanced capabilities. The performance of this computational framework is tested in the context of online tutoring scenarios using the iCub robotic platform. Such an experimental environment requires development of techniques and algorithms suited for incremental learning and real-time processing.},

abstract = {Studies of language acquisition often assume that children will simply begin to learn language, without questioning what sets the whole process in motion. In How Children Learn Language, Lorraine McCune thoroughly examines the often-neglected topic of how children discover the possibility of language and demonstrates that pro-language development involves a dynamic system of social, cognitive, and vocal variables that come together to enable the transition to referential language. The relationship with a caregiver is integral to this development because language is a system of symbolic communication that can emerge only with children's recognition that they are separate from others. McCune sees language learning as constructed equally from needing to develop meanings and learning to produce the sound sequences that represent them. In order for this dual construction to be effective, however, children must discover their capacity to refer to objects and events in the world by having their internal states of focused attention accompanied by an autonomic, physiologically based vocalization, which is the grunt that results from physical or mental effort. When the grunt is intensified and directed at a conversational partner, as when children attempt to convey an internal state, it becomes their first protoword. How Children Learn Language will be a valuable resource on pre-language development for students and researchers in developmental psychology.

Most existing spoken dialog systems are designed to work in a static, well-defined domain, and are not well suited to tasks in which the domain may change or be extended over time. This paper shows how recurrent neural networks can be effectively applied to tracking in an extended domain with new slots and values not present in training data. The method is evaluated in the third Dialog State Tracking Challenge, where it significantly outperforms other approaches in the task of tracking the user's goal. A method for online unsupervised adaptation to new domains is also presented. Unsupervised adaptation is shown to be helpful in improving word-based recurrent neural networks, which work directly from the speech recognition results. Word-based dialog state tracking is attractive as it does not require engineering a spoken language understanding system for use in the new domain and it avoids the need for a general purpose intermediate semantic representation.},

Our approach assumes a parametric form for the policy that the robot uses to choose actions in response to a natural language command that factors based on the structure of the language. We use a gradient method to optimize model parameters. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the model on a corpus of commands given to a robotic forklift by untrained users.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, there has been an increasing emphasis on studying the link between infant speech perception and later language acquisition. This research has yielded some seemingly contradictory findings: In some studies infants appear to use phonetic and indexical detail that they fail to use in other studies. In this article we present a new, unified framework for accounting for these divergent findings. PRIMIR (a developmental framework for Processing Rich Information from Multidimensional Interactive Representations) assumes there is rich information available in the speech input and that the child picks up and organizes this information along a number of multidimensional interactive planes. Use of this rich information depends on the joint activity of 3 dynamic filters. These filters—the initial biases, the developmental level of the child, and requirements of the specific language task the child is facing—work together to differentially direct attention to 1 (or more) plane. In this article we outline the contradictory data that need to be explained, elucidate PRIMIR, including its underlying assumptions and overall architecture, and compare it to existing frameworks. We conclude by presenting core predictions of PRIMIR. Research on speech perception and word learning in infancy has produced a number of divergent findings that are difficult to reconcile within any of the existing models. In illustration of the complexity of the data generated, it has been known for some time that infants show categorical perception and treat variable instances of the same phonetic category as equivalent (for reviews, see Jusczyk, 1987; Werker, 1995).},

abstract = {Abstract: It is hypothesized that Creole languages are largely invented by children and show fundamental similarities, which derive from a biological program for language. The structures of Hawaiian Pidgin and Hawaiian Creole are contrasted, and evidence is provided to show that the latter derived from the former in a single generation. A realistic model of the processes of Creole formation shows how several specific historical and demographic factors interacted to restrict, in varying degrees, the access of pidgin speakers to the dominant language, and hence the nature of input to the children of those speakers. It is shown that the resulting similarities of Creole languages derive from a single grammar with a restricted list of categories and operations. However, grammars of individual Creoles will differ from this grammar to a varying extent: The degree of difference will correlate very closely with the quantity of dominant-language input, which in turn is controlled by extralinguistic factors. Alternative explanations of the above phenomena are surveyed, in particular, substratum theory and monogenesis: Both are found inadequate to account for the facts. Primary acquisition is examined in light of the general hypothesis, and it is suggested that the bioprogram provides a skeletal model of language which the child can then readily convert into the target language. Cases of systematic error and precocious learning provide indirect support for the hypothesis. Some conjectures are made concerning the evolutionary origins of the bioprogram and what study of Creoles and related topics might reveal about language origins},

abstract = {A rich body of work in adult bilinguals documents an interconnected lexical network across languages, such that early word retrieval is language independent. This literature has yielded a number of influential models of bilingual semantic memory. However, extant models provide limited predictions about the emergence of lexical organization in bilingual first language acquisition (BFLA). Empirical evidence from monolingual infants suggests that lexical networks emerge early in development as children integrate phonological and semantic information. These findings tell us little about the interaction between 2 languages in early bilingual memory. To date, an understanding of when and how languages interact in early bilingual development is lacking. In this literature review, we present research documenting lexical-semantic development across monolingual and bilingual infants. This is followed by a discussion of current models of bilingual language representation and organization and their ability to account for the available empirical evidence. Together, these theoretical and empirical accounts inform and highlight unexplored areas of research and guide future work on early bilingual memory. (PsycINFO Database Record},

However, such systems are challenging to build, currently requiring manual engineering of substantial domain-specific task knowledge and dialog management strategies. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn procedural dialog systems given only light supervision, of the type that can be provided by non-experts. We consider domains where the required task knowledge exists in textual form (e.g., instructional web pages) and where system builders have access to statements of user intent (e.g., search query logs or dialog interactions). To learn from such textual resources, we describe a novel approach that first automatically extracts task knowledge from instructions, then learns a dialog manager over this task knowledge to provide assistance. Evaluation in a Microsoft Office domain shows that the individual components are highly accurate and can be integrated into a dialog system that provides effective help to users. {\textcopyright} 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract = {Previous studies have found that children can use socialpragmatic cues to determine " which one " of several objects or " which one " of several actions an adult intends to indicate with a novel word. The current studies attempted to determine whether children can also use such cues to determine " what kind " of referent, object, or action, an adult intends to indicate. In the first study, 27monthold children heard an adult use a nonce word in conjunction with a nameless object while it was engaged in a nameless action. The discourse situation leading into this naming event was manipulated so that in one condition the target action was the one new element in the discourse context at the time of the naming event, and in another condition the target object was the one new element. Results showed that children learned the new word for whichever element was new to the discourse context. The second study followed this same general method, but in this case children in one condition watched as an adult engaged in preparatory behaviors that indicated her desire that the child perform the action before she produced the novel word, whereas children in another condition saw no such preparation. Results showed that children who saw the action preparation learned the new word for the action, whereas children who saw no preparation learned the new word for the object. These two studies demonstrate the important role of socialpragmatic information in early word learning, and suggest that if there is a Whole Object assumption in early lexical acquisition, it is an assumption that may be very easily overridden. The socialpragmatic theory of language acquisition holds that language is an inherently social phenomenon and that young children can learn new pieces of language only by entering into some type of joint attentional focus with a mature language user (Bruner, 1983; Tomasello, 1992a).

abstract = {Synchrony, a construct used across multiple fields to denote the temporal relationship between events, is applied to the study of parent–infant interactions and suggested as a model for intersubjectivity. Three types of timed relationships between the parent and child's affective behavior are assessed: concurrent, sequential, and organized in an ongoing patterned format, and the development of each is charted across the first year. Viewed as a formative experience for the maturation of the social brain, synchrony impacts the development of selfregulation, symbol use, and empathy across childhood and adolescence. Different patterns of synchrony with mother, father, and the family and across cultures describe relationshipspecific modes of coordination. The capacity to engage in temporallymatched interactions is based on physiological mechanisms, in particular oscillator systems, such as the biological clock and cardiac pacemaker, and attachmentrelated hormones, such as oxytocin. Specific patterns of synchrony are described in a range of child, parentand contextrelated risk conditions, pointing to its ecological relevance and usefulness for the study of developmental psychopathology. A perspective that underscores the organization of discrete relational behaviors into emergent patterns and considers time a central parameter of emotion and communication systems may be useful to the study of interpersonal intimacy and its potential for personal transformation across the lifespan.},

The case that I want to make is that babyhood is much more important to our lives than many people realise. A lot of the behaviour that worries us in later childhood, such as aggression, hyperactivity, obesity, depression and poor school performance, has already been shaped by children's experiences in babyhood. For those of you who have not studied the scientific literature, this might seem a bit farfetched. I was rather amazed at just how significant babyhood is, when I first undertook the research for my book 'Why Love Matters'.

They learn how to cope with stress by having an experience of someone being with them and helping them to cope. But they need to have these experiences consistently, over and over again, to lay down the pathways, during the first and second years of life. As I mentioned earlier, the first year of life is about making connections in the brain. But in the second and third years of childhood that huge tangled mass of connections starts to get “pruned” - on a “use it or lose it” basis. Basically, we keep the pathways that are most used and most useful in our particular social environment – and lose those pathways that have not been used that much. That means that if as babies and young children we live with angry, aggressive people, we will keep pathways that help us to be alert to anger and aggression, and if we live with people who are attentive to other people, we will keep the pathways that help us to be attentive.},

We also provide a qualitative analysis of the groundings learned in the game, visualizing what words are understood better with multimodal sensory information as well as identifying learned word meanings that correlate with physical object properties (e.g. 'small' negatively correlates with object weight).},

In this paper, we extend an existing model of incremental semantic processing in dialogue, based around the Dynamic Syntax (DS) grammar framework, to provide a lowlevel, integrated account of backchannels, clarification requests and their responses; demonstrating that they can be accounted for as part of the core semantic structurebuilding mechanisms of the grammar, rather than via higher level pragmatic phenomena such as intention recognition, or treatment as an " unofficial " part of the conversation. The end result is an incremental model in which words, not turns, are seen as procedures for contextual update and backchannels serve to align participant semantic processing contexts and thus ease the production and interpretation of subsequent conversational actions. We also show how clarification requests and their following responses and repair can be modelled within the same DS framework, wherein the divergence and realignment effort in participants' semantic processing drives conversations forward.},

abstract = {With emerging conversational data, automated content analysis is needed for better data interpretation, so that it is accurately understood and can be effectively integrated and utilized in various applications. ICSI meeting corpus is a publicly released data set of multi-party meetings in an organization that has been released over a decade ago, and has been fostering meeting understanding research since then. The original data collection includes transcription of participant turns as well as meta-data annotations, such as disfluencies and dialog act tags. This paper presents an extended set of annotations for the ICSI meeting corpus with a goal of deeply understanding meeting conversations, where participant turns are annotated by actionable items that could be performed by an automated meeting assistant. In addition to the user utterances that contain an actionable item, annotations also include the arguments associated with the actionable item. The set of actionable items are determined by aligning human-human interactions to human-machine interactions, where a data annotation schema designed for a virtual personal assistant (human-machine genre) is adapted to the meetings domain (human-human genre). The data set is formed by annotating participants' utterances in meetings with potential intents/actions considering their contexts. The set of actions target what could be accomplished by an automated meeting assistant, such as taking a note of action items that a participant commits to, or finding emails or topic related documents that were mentioned during the meeting. A total of 10 defined intents/actions are considered as actionable items in meetings. Turns that include actionable intents were annotated for 22 public ICSI meetings, that include a total of 21K utterances, segmented by speaker turns. Participants' spoken turns, possible actions along with associated arguments and their vector representations as computed by convolutional deep structured semantic models are included in the data set for future research. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the data set and analyze the performance of applying convolutional deep structured semantic models for an actionable item detection task.

abstract = {This paper introduces Logical Semantics with Perception (LSP), a model for grounded lan- guage acquisition that learns to map natu- ral language statements to their referents in a physical environment. For example, given an image, LSP can map the statement “blue mug on the table” to the set of image seg- ments showing blue mugs on tables. LSP learns physical representations for both cate- gorical (“blue,” “mug”) and relational (“on”) language, and also learns to compose these representations to produce the referents of en- tire statements. We further introduce a weakly supervised training procedure that estimates LSP's parameters using annotated referents for entire statements, without annotated ref- erents for individual words or the parse struc- ture of the statement. We perform experiments on two applications: scene understanding and geographical question answering. We find that LSP outperforms existing, less expressive models that cannot represent relational lan- guage. We further find that weakly supervised training is competitive with fully supervised training while requiring significantly less an- notation effort.},

@phdthesis{KenningtonDissertation2016,
abstract = {The primary concern of this thesis is to model the resolution of spoken referring expressions made in order to identify objects; in particular, everyday objects that can be perceived visually and distinctly from other objects. The practical goal of such a model is for it to be implemented as a component for use in a live, interactive, autonomous spoken dialogue system. The requirement of interaction imposes an added complication; one that has been ignored in previous models and approaches to automatic reference resolution: the model must attempt to resolve the reference incrementally as it unfolds–not wait until the end of the referring expression to begin the resolution process. Beyond components in dialogue systems, reference has been a major player in the philosophy of meaning for longer than a century. For example, Gottlob Frege (1892) has distinguished between Sinn (sense) and Bedeutung (reference), discussed how they are related and how they relate to the meaning of words and expressions. It has furthermore been argued (e.g., Dahlgren (1976)) that reference to entities in the actual world is not just a fundamental notion of semantic theory, but the fundamental notion; for an individual acquiring a language, understanding the meaning of many words and concepts is done via the task of reference, beginning in early childhood. In this thesis, we pursue an account of word meaning that is based on perception of objects; for example, the meaning of the word red is based on visual features that are selected as distinguishing red objects from non-red ones. This thesis proposes two statistical models of incremental reference resolution. Given ex- amples of referring expressions and visual aspects of the objects to which those expressions referred, both model components learn a functional mapping between the words of the refer- ring expressions and the visual aspects. A generative model, the simple incremental update model, presented in Chapter 5, uses a mediating variable to learn the mapping, whereas a dis- criminative model, the words-as-classifiers model, presented in Chapter 6, learns the mapping directly and improves over the generative model. Both models have been evaluated in various reference resolution tasks to objects in virtual scenes as well as real, tangible objects. This thesis shows that both models work robustly and are able to resolve referring expressions made in reference to visually present objects despite realistic, noisy conditions of speech and object recognition. A theoretical and practical comparison is also provided. Special emphasis is given to the discriminative model in this thesis because of its simplicity and ability to represent word meanings. It is in the learning and application of this model that gives credence to the above claim that reference is the fundamental notion for semantic theory and that meanings of (visual) words is done through experiencing referring expressions made to objects that are visually perceivable.},

abstract = {The present paper presents an anaphoric account of presupposition. It is argued that presuppositional expressions should not be seen as referring expressions, nor is presupposition to be explicated in terms of some non-standard logic. The notion of presupposition should not be relegated to a pragmatic theory either. Instead presuppositional expressions are claimed to be anaphoric expressions which have internal structure and semantic content. In fact they only differ from pronouns and other semantically less loaded anaphors in that they have more descriptive content. It is this fact which enables them to create an antecedent in case discourse does not provide one. If their capacity to accommodate is taken into account they can be treated by basically the same mechanism which handles the resolution of pronouns. The theory is elaborated in the framework of discourse representation theory. It is shown that pragmatic factors interfere in the resolution of presuppositional anaphors. The resulting account can neither be classified as wholly semantic nor wholly pragmatic. Section 1 presents a survey of standing problems in the theory of presupposition projection and discusses the major competing approaches. An argumentation for a purely anaphoric account of presupposition is given in section 2. Section 3 presents a coding of presuppositional expressions in an extension of discourse representation theory. The final section is devoted to a discussion of the constraints which govern the resolution of presuppositional anaphors.},

abstract = {As user demand scales for intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Apple's Siri, Google's Google Now, and Microsoft's Cortana, we are approaching the computational limits of current datacenter architectures. It is an open ques- tion how future server architectures should evolve to enable this emerging class of applications, and the lack of an open- source IPA workload is an obstacle in addressing this ques- tion. In this paper, we present the design of Sirius, an open end-to-end IPA web-service application that accepts queries in the form of voice and images, and responds with natu- ral language. We then use this workload to investigate the implications of four points in the design space of future accelerator-based server architectures spanning traditional CPUs, GPUs, manycore throughput co-processors, and FP- GAs. To investigate future server designs for Sirius, we de- compose Sirius into a suite of 7 benchmarks (Sirius Suite) comprising the computationally intensive bottlenecks of Sir- ius. We port Sirius Suite to a spectrum of accelerator plat- forms and use the performance and power trade-offs across these platforms to perform a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis of various server design points. In our study, we find that accelerators are critical for the future scalability of IPA services. Our results show that GPU- and FPGA- accelerated servers improve the query latency on average by 10× and 16×. For a given throughput, GPU- and FPGA- accelerated servers can reduce the TCO of datacenters by 2.6× and 1.4×, respectively. Permission},

Within this framework, we implement several popular algorithms for topical inference, including Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in a way that makes them completely independent of the training corpus size. Particular emphasis is placed on straightforward and intuitive framework design, so that modifications and extensions of the methods and/or their application by interested practitioners are effortless. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a real-world scenario of computing document similarities within an existing digital library DML-CZ.},

abstract = {Memory is fleeting. New material rapidly obliterates previous material. How then can the brain deal successfully with the continual deluge of linguistic input? We argue that, to deal with this "Now-or-Never" bottleneck, the brain must compress and recode linguistic input as rapidly as possible. This observation has strong implications for the nature of language processing: (i) the language system must "eagerly" recode and compress linguistic input; (ii) as the bottleneck recurs at each new representational level, the language system must build a multi-level linguistic representation; and (iii) it must deploy all available information predictively to ensure that local linguistic ambiguities are dealt with "Right-First-Time;" once the original input is lost, there is no way for the language system to recover. This is "Chunk-and-Pass" processing. Similarly, language learning must also occur in the here-and-now. This implies that language acquisition is learning to process, rather than inducing a grammar. Moreover, this perspective provides a cognitive foundation for grammaticalization and other aspects of language change. Chunk-and-Pass processing also helps explain a variety of core properties of language, including its multi-level representational structure and duality of patterning. This approach promises to create a direct relationship between psycholinguistics and linguistic theory. More generally, we outline a framework within which to integrate often disconnected inquiries into language processing, language acquisition, and language change and evolution.},

abstract = {The paper presents work in progress on an implemented model of situated dialogue processing. The underlying assumption is that to understand situated dialogue, communicated meaning needs to be related to the situation(s) it refers to. The model couples incremental processing to a notion of bidirectional connectivity, inspired by how humans process visually situated language. Analyzing an utterance in a ''word-by-word, left-to-right'' fashion, a representation of possible utterance interpretations is gradually built up. In a top-down fashion, the model tries to ground these interpretations in situation awareness, through which they can prime what is focused on in a situation. In a bottom-up fashion, the (im)possibility to ground certain interpretations primes how the analysis of the utterance further unfolds. The paper discusses the implementation of the model in a distributed, cognitive architecture for human-robot interaction, and presents an evaluation on a test suite. The evaluation quantifies the effects linguistic interpretation has on priming utterance processing, and discusses how the evaluation can be extended to include situation context.},

A token-based approach combining the use of local classifiers, which exploit local utterance features, and global classifiers which use the outputs of local classifiers applied to previous and subsequent tokens, is shown to result in excellent dialogue act recognition scores for unsegmented spoken dialogue. This can be seen as a significant step forward towards the development of fully incremental, on-line meth- ods for computing the meaning of utterances in spoken dialogue.},

Our experimental results show that this new strategy significantly improves upon the reliability of the decoupled planning approach. Overall in our tests, the new strategy outperforms both the centralized and decoupled planning approach, indicating that in practice it can be a better choice, than both the centralized and decoupled approach, for solving multi-robot planning problems.},

abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in recent years in the development of dialogue systems that support robust and efficient human-machine interaction using spoken language. Spoken dialogue technology allows various interactive applications to be built and used for practical purposes, and research focuses on issues that aim to increase the system's communicative competence by including aspects of error correction, cooperation, multimodality, and adaptation in context. This book gives a comprehensive view of state-of-the-art techniques that are used to build spoken dialogue systems. It provides an overview of the basic issues such as system architectures, various dialogue management methods, system evaluation, and also surveys advanced topics concerning extensions of the basic model to more conversational setups. The goal of the book is to provide an introduction to the methods, problems, and solutions that are used in dialogue system development and evaluation. It presents dialogue modelling and system development issues relevant in both academic and industrial environments and also discusses requirements and challenges for advanced interaction management and future research.

abstract = {Spoken contributions in dialogue often continue or complete earlier contributions by either the same or a different speaker. These compound contributions (CCs) thus provide a natural context for investigations of incremental processing in dialogue. We present a corpus study which confirms that CCs are a key dialogue phenomenon: almost 20{\%} of contributions fit our general definition of CCs, with nearly 3{\%} being the cross-person case most often studied. The results suggest that processing is word-by-word incremental, as splits can occur within syntactic ‘constituents'; however, some systematic differences between sameand cross-person cases indicate important dialogue-specific pragmatic effects. An experimental study then investigates these effects by artificially introducing CCs into multi-party text dialogue. Results suggest that CCs affect people's expectations about who will speak next and whether other participants have formed a coalition or ‘party'. Together, these studies suggest that CCs require an incremental processing mechanism that can provide a resource for constructing linguistic constituents that span multiple contributions and multiple participants. They also suggest the need to model higher-level dialogue units that have consequences for the organisation of turn-taking and for the development of a shared context.},

@article{Dethlefs2015,
abstract = {Incremental dialogue systems are often perceived as more responsive and natural because they are able to address phenomena of turn-taking and overlapping speech, such as backchannels or barge-ins. Previous work in this area has often identified distinctive prosodic features, or features relating to syntactic or semantic completeness, as marking appropriate places of turn-taking. In a separate strand of work, psycholinguistic studies have established a connection between information density and prominence in language - the less expected a linguistic unit is in a particular context, the more likely it is to be linguistically marked. This has been observed across linguistic levels, including the prosodic, which plays an important role in predicting overlapping speech. In this article, we explore the hypothesis that information density (ID) also plays a role in turn-taking. Specifically, we aim to show that humans are sensitive to the peaks and troughs of information density in speech, and that overlapping speech at ID troughs is perceived as more acceptable than overlaps at ID peaks. To test our hypothesis, we collect human ratings for three models of generating overlapping speech based on features of: (1) prosody and semantic or syntactic completeness, (2) information density, and (3) both types of information. Results show that over 50{\%} of users preferred the version using both types of features, followed by a preference for information density features alone. This indicates a clear human sensitivity to the effects of information density in spoken language and provides a strong motivation to adopt this metric for the design, development and evaluation of turn-taking modules in spoken and incremental dialogue systems.},

Experiment 1 demonstrated that from the earliest moments of processing, addressees interpreted referring expressions with respect to referential domains constrained by the conversation. Analysis of eye movements during the conversation showed elimination of standard competition effects seen with scripted language. Results from Experiment 2 pinpointed two pragmatic factors responsible for restriction of the referential domains used by speakers to design referential expressions and demonstrated that the same factors predict whether addressees consider local competitors to be potential referents during on-line interpretation of the same expressions. These experiments demonstrate for the first time that on-line interpretation of referring expressions in conversation is facilitated by referential domains constrained by pragmatic factors which predict when addressees are likely to encounter temporary ambiguity in language processing.},

abstract = {Statistical spoken dialogue systems based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) have been shown to be more robust to speech recognition errors by maintaining a belief distribution over multiple dialogue states and making policy decisions based on the entire distribution rather than the single most likely hypothesis. To date most POMDP-based systems have used generative trackers. However, concerns about modelling accuracy have created interest in discriminative methods, and recent results from the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC2) have shown that discriminative trackers can significantly outperform generative models in terms of tracking accuracy. The aim of this paper is to investigate the extent to which these improvements translate into improved task completion rates when incorporated into a spoken dialogue system. To do this, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) tracker described by Henderson et al in DSTC2 was integrated into the Cambridge statistical dialogue system and compared with the existing generative Bayesian network tracker. Using a Gaussian Process (GP) based policy, the experimental results indicate that the system using the RNN tracker performs significantly better than the system with the original Bayesian network tracker.},

abstract = {We present a new modelling framework for dialogue management based on the concept of probabilistic rules. Probabilistic rules are defined as structured mappings between logical conditions and probabilistic effects. They function as high-level templates for probabilistic graphical models and may include unknown parameters whose values are estimated from data using Bayesian inference. Thanks to their use of logical abstractions, probabilistic rules are able to encode the probability and utility models employed in dialogue management in a compact and human-readable form. As a consequence, they can reduce the amount of dialogue data required for parameter estimation and allow system designers to directly incorporate their expert domain knowledge into the dialogue models.$\backslash$nEmpirical results of a user evaluation in a human–robot interaction task with 37 participants show that a dialogue manager structured with probabilistic rules outperforms both purely hand-crafted and purely statistical methods on a range of subjective and objective quality metrics. The framework is implemented in a software toolkit called OpenDial, which can be used to develop various types of dialogue systems based on probabilistic rules.},

In both domains, the presumed "natural" categories were consistently easier to learn than the "distorted" categories. Even when not central, natural prototype stimuli tended to be more rapidly learned and more often chosen as the most typical example of the category than were other stimuli.

abstract = {Reinforcement learning methods are increasingly used to optimise dialogue policies from experience. Most current techniques are model-free: they directly estimate the utility of various actions, without explicit model of the interaction dynamics. In this paper, we investigate an alternative strategy grounded in model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning. Bayesian inference is used to maintain a posterior distribution over the model parameters, reflecting the model uncertainty. This parameter distribution is gradually refined as more data is collected and simultaneously used to plan the agent's actions. Within this learning framework, we carried out experiments with two alternative formalisations of the transition model, one encoded with standard multinomial distributions, and one structured with probabilistic rules. We demonstrate the potential of our approach with empirical results on a user simulator constructed from Wizard-of-Oz data in a human-robot interaction scenario. The results illustrate in particular the benefits of capturing prior domain knowledge with high-level rules.},

abstract = {Generating referring expressions is a task that has received a great deal of attention in the natural-language generation community, with an increasing amount of recent effort targeted at the generation of multimodal referring expressions. However, most implemented systems tend to assume very little shared knowledge between the speaker and the hearer, and therefore must generate fully-elaborated linguistic references. Some systems do include a representation of the physical context or the dialogue context; however, other sources of contextual information are not normally used. Also, the generated references normally consist only of language and, possibly, deictic pointing gestures. When referring to objects in the context of a task-based interaction involving jointly manipulating objects, a much richer notion of context is available, which permits a wider range of referring options. In particular, when conversational partners cooperate on a mutual task in a shared environment, objects can be made accessible simply by manipulating them as part of the task. We demonstrate that such expressions are common in a corpus of human-human dialogues based on constructing virtual objects, and then describe how this type of reference can be incorporated into the output of a humanoid robot that engages in similar joint construction dialogues with a human partner.},

abstract = {Incremental processing offers the potential for dialogue systems to produce more natural, spontaneous conversational behaviour. This processing strategy comes at a price, though, which is that processing results may have to be revised when more input becomes available. We distinguish between two possible consequences of such revisions: a) If no observable system reaction has been produced yet, revision is just a matter of properly keeping internal state, and can be handled along the lines of the IU model of (Schlangen and Skantze, 2009). b) If however an observable reaction has been produced, revocation itself becomes a dialogue move, and as such must be handled by the dialogue manager. In this paper, we describe a dialogue manager that is capable of doing so, and provide a first discussion of how to handle such self-corrections when producing output. This dialogue manager makes a connection between utterance-level incrementality and dialogue-level incrementality by using concepts from the IU model also internally; we discuss some of the implications of this approach.},

Rapidly adding intents is one of the main bottlenecks to scaling—adding functionality to—personal assistants. In this paper we show how interactive learning can be applied to the creation of statistical intent mod- els. Interactive learning [10] combines model definition, labeling, model building, active learning, model evaluation, and feature engineering in a way that allows a domain expert—who need not be a machine learning expert—to build classifiers. We apply interactive learning to build a handful of intent models in three different domains. In controlled lab experiments, we show that intent detectors can be built using interactive learning, and then improved in a novel end-to-end visualization tool.We then applied this method to a publicly deployed personal assistant—Mi- crosoft Cortana — where a non-machine learning expert built an intent model in just over two hours, yielding excellent performance in the commercial service.},

Based on the PARADISE method known from spoken dialog systems, we have defined and applied internal and external metrics for fine-grained and largely automatable identification of such relationships. Through evaluation with n=28 subjects, indicator functions explaining up to 55{\%} of variation in several satisfaction metrics were found.

The authors found that these conversations impaired driver's reactions to vehicles braking in front of them. The authors assessed whether this impairment could be attributed to a withdrawal of attention from the visual scene, yielding a form of inattention blindness. Cell phone conversations impaired explicit recognition memory for roadside billboards. Eye-tracking data indicated that this was due to reduced attention to foveal information. This interpretation was bolstered by data showing that cell phone conversations impaired implicit perceptual memory for items presented at fixation. The data suggest that the impairment of driving performance produced by cell phone conversations is mediated, at least in part, by reduced attention to visual inputs.},

abstract = {Event detection is used to classify recorded gaze points into periods of fixation, saccade, smooth pursuit, blink, and noise. Although there is an overall consensus that current algorithms for event detection have serious flaws and that a de facto standard for event detection does not exist, surprisingly little work has been done to remedy this problem. We suggest a new velocity-based algorithm that takes several of the previously known limitations into account. Most important, the new algorithm identifies so-called glissades, a wobbling movement at the end of many saccades, as a separate class of eye movements. Part of the solution involves designing an adaptive velocity threshold that makes the event detection less sensitive to variations in noise level and the algorithm settings-free for the user. We demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm on eye movements recorded during reading and scene perception and compare it with two of the most commonly used algorithms today. Results show that, unlike the currently used algorithms, fixations, saccades, and glissades are robustly identified by the new algorithm. Using this algorithm, we found that glissades occur in about half of the saccades, during both reading and scene perception, and that they have an average duration close to 24 msec. Due to the high prevalence and long durations of glissades, we argue that researchers must actively choose whether to assign the glissades to saccades or fixations; the choice affects dependent variables such as fixation and saccade duration significantly. Current algorithms do not offer this choice, and their assignments of each glissade are largely arbitrary.},

The key idea is to model perceptual meanings as classifiers of perceptual input. Furthermore, we show how perceptual aspects of meaning can be updated as a result of observing language use in interaction, thereby enabling fine-grained semantic plasticity and semantic coordination. This requires a framework where intensions are (i) represented independently of extensions, and (ii) structured objects which can be modified as a result of learning. We use Type Theory with Records (TTR), a formal semantics framework that starts from the idea that information and meaning is founded on our ability to perceive and classify the world, i.e. to perceive objects and situations as being of types. As an example of our approach, we show how a simple classifier of spatial information based on the Perceptron can be cast in TTR.},

@article{Putnam1973,
abstract = {UNCLEAR as it is, the traditional doctrine that the notion "meaning" possesses the extension/intension ambiguity has certain typical consequences. The doctrine that the meaning of a term is a concept carried the implication that mean- ings are mental entities. Frege, however, rebelled against this "psy- chologism." Feeling that meanings are public property-that the same meaning can be "grasped" by more than one person and by persons at different times-he identified concepts (and hence "intensions" or meanings) with abstract entities rather than mental entities. However, "grasping" these abstract entities was still an individual psychological act. None of these philosophers doubted that understanding a word (knowing its intension) was just a matter of being in a certain psychological state (somewhat in the way in which knowing how to factor numbers in one's head is just a mat- ter of being in a certain very complex psychological state).},

In this paper, we present an application of IDP that shows its effectiveness in a task-oriented dialog system. We have implemented an IDP strategy and deployed it for one month on a real-user system. We compared the resulting dialogs with dialogs produced over the previous month without IDP. Results show that the incremental strategy significantly improved system performance by eliminating long and often off-task utterances that generally produce poor speech recognition results. User behavior is also affected; the user tends to shorten utterances after being interrupted by the system.},

Participants were classified with bulimia nervosa (BN; n =39), binge eating disorder (BED; n = 69), or controls (CON; n = 203). RESULTS: In terms of typical eating behaviors, the BN group ate significantly fewer meals, particularly lunches, than the other two groups. Atypical eating, such as nibbling, eating double meals and nocturnal eating, was significantly more common in the eating disorder groups. More frequent breakfast consumption was associated with lower BMI in the BED and CON groups, and more frequent meal consumption was associated with less binge eating in the BED group only. DISCUSSION: Our study revealed differences in typical and atypical eating patterns, and associations with weight and eating disorder behaviors among eating disorder and control groups.},

abstract = {Behavior and experience are organized around the enjoyment and pursuit of incentives. During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species. The theory offers implications for motivation; etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of depression; drug use; and other social problem areas.},

abstract = {Seven experiments were conducted to examine the development and application of abstracted and perspective-flexible mental representations, or spatial mental models. Participants read spatial descriptions written in route and survey perspectives and undertook several memory tasks demanding the application of both declarative memories and spatial mental models. Experiment 1 manipulated reader experience by varying description exposure and found that while spatial mental models were available after only one read of a survey description, several reads were necessary to develop functionally similar spatial mental models from route descriptions; this is in contrast to declarative memories which varied only as a function of experience and not description perspective. Experiment 2 examined self-paced description reading times and found that readers tended to be slower overall while reading spatial sentences during route descriptions over the course of three read cycles, supporting Experiment 1 results; this is in contrast to non-spatial sentences which showed no differences as a function of description perspective. Experiments 3 and 4 used a dual-task methodology to examine the working memory mechanisms involved during spatial description reading, and demonstrated interactive involvement of visuospatial, articulatory, and central executive resources towards declarative memory and spatial mental model development. Experiments 5 and 6 used the same dual task methodology during retrieval of spatial mental models, and found that these models are not necessarily a collection of inferences developed during reading but rather a foundation from which to extract information towards inference generation; further, they demonstrate that both relatively coarse surface representations of the text and spatial mental models are available for retrieval. Finally, Experiment 7 examined the influence of goals and perspective preferences on spatial mental model development and found that overall those with a survey preference were better-able to develop perspective-flexible spatial mental models, while those with a route or landmark preference were better-able to learn landmark identities; goal instantiation did not show any effects. Taken together the results demonstrate that the development and application of spatial mental models are contingent upon multiple working memory systems that interact importantly with representational formats, extent of experience, and reader preferences.

abstract = {Four dual-task experiments examined visuospatial, articulatory, and central executive working memory involvement during the development and application of spatial mental models. In Experiments 1 and 2 participants read route and survey spatial descriptions while undertaking one of four secondary tasks targeting working memory components. Converging evidence from map drawing and statement verification tasks indicates that while articulatory mechanisms are involved in processing the language itself, visuospatial and central executive mechanisms are involved in developing spatial mental models, particularly during route description reading. In Experiments 3 and 4 participants undertook the same working memory tasks, but did so during testing; results from memory and secondary task performance converge to demonstrate that using spatial mental models is a visuospatially and centrally demanding process, particularly following route description learning. Taken together, results demonstrate that spatial mental model development and application are contingent upon multiple working memory systems and interact with representational formats. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments that (1) examined the extent to which the learned perspective is maintained in memory; (2) examined a test comprehension issue, that of determinacy, as it applies to spatial descriptions; and (3) assessed the interaction between perspective and determinacy. In both experiments, college students received a spatial description relating a route through an environment. Descriptions differed in terms of the spatial perspective presented, either route or survey, and the degree to which spatial information was determined, either indeterminate, determinate, or overdeterminate. In Exp 1, 109 Ss read the description and in Exp 2, 65 Ss listened to the description and took notes for later use. Results indicate that perspective and determinacy influenced memory and the contents of participants' notes. Perspective influenced the integration of information. The effect of determinacy depended on degree. Indeterminacy influenced use of a mental representation, in particular during wayfinding. Overdeterminacy stressed working memory, thereby influencing many aspects of performance. Findings indicate that perspective and determinacy, which commonly vary in spatial descriptions, influence the ability to efficiently use descriptions. Descriptions are appended.

While this view allows to set up a sound logic of demonstratives, the direct-referential role assigned to pointing gestures has never been scrutinized thoroughly in semantics or pragmatics. We investigate the semantics and pragmatics of co-verbal pointing from a foundational perspective combining experiments, statistical investigation, computer simulation and theoretical modeling techniques in a novel manner. We evaluate various referential hypotheses with a corpus of object identification games set up in experiments in which body movement tracking techniques have been extensively used to generate precise pointing measurements. Statistical investigation and computer simulations show that especially distal areas in the pointing domain falsify the semantic direct-referential hypotheses concerning pointing gestures. As an alternative, we propose that reference involving pointing rests on a default inference which we specify using the empirical data. These results raise numerous problems for classical semantics-pragmatics interfaces: we argue for pre-semantic pragmatics in order to account for inferential reference in addition to classical post-semantic Gricean pragmatics.},

abstract = {Speech and natural language are natural and convenient ways to interact with artificial characters. Current use of language in games, however, is limited to menu systems and inter- player communication. To achieve smooth linguistic commu- nication with synthetic agents, research should focus on how language connects to the situation in which it occurs. Taking account of the physical scene (where is the speaker located, what is around her, when does she speak?) as well as the func- tional aspects of the situation (why did he choose to speak? What are his likely plans?) can disambiguate the linguistic signal in form and content. We present a game environment to collect time synchronized speech and action streams, to visualize these data and to annotate them at different stages of processing. We further sketch a framework for situated speech understanding on such data, taking into account as- pects of the physical situation as well as the plans players follow. Our results show that this combination of influences achieves remarkable improvements over the individual situ- ation models despite the very noisy and spontaneous nature of the speech involved. This work provides a basis for devel- oping characters that use situated natural spoken language to communicate meaningfully with human players. Introduction},

@book{boole1854investigation,
abstract = {First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotle's logic to formulas in the form of equations—by itself a revolutionary idea. Second, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic—another revolutionary idea—involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. Third, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”. Boole's work founded the discipline of algebraic logic. It is often, but mistakenly, credited as being the source of what we know today as Boolean algebra. In fact, however, Boole's algebra differs from modern Boolean algebra: in Boole's algebra A+B cannot be interpreted by set union, due to the permissibility of uninterpretable terms in Boole's calculus. Therefore algebras on Boole's account cannot be interpreted by sets under the operations of union, intersection and complement, as is the case with modern Boolean algebra. The task of developing the modern account of Boolean algebra fell to Boole's successors in the tradition of algebraic logic (Jevons 1869, Peirce 1880, Jevons 1890, Schr{\"{o}}der 1890, Huntingdon 1904).},

We used synthesized German sentences with grammatical ambiguities to test the additional workload caused by human sentence processing during driving. For the driving task, we used the Continuous Tracking and Reaction (ConTRe) task, which we believe is suitable for the measurement of the fine-grained effects of linguistically-related workload phenomena in automotive environments, as it provides millisecond-level driving deviation measurements on a continuous course. We applied the task in an eye-tracking environment, using a pupillometric measure of cognitive workload called the Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA).},

@article{Horrey2006,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The performance costs associated with cell phone use while driving were assessed meta-analytically using standardized measures of effect size along five dimensions. BACKGROUND: There have been many studies on the impact of cell phone use on driving, showing some mixed findings. METHODS: Twenty-three studies (contributing 47 analysis entries) met the appropriate conditions for the meta-analysis. The statistical results from each of these studies were converted into effect sizes and combined in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, there were clear costs to driving performance when drivers were engaged in cell phone conversations. However, subsequent analyses indicated that these costs were borne primarily by reaction time tasks, with far smaller costs associated with tracking (lane-keeping) performance. Hands-free and handheld phones revealed similar patterns of results for both measures of performance. Conversation tasks tended to show greater costs than did information-processing tasks (e.g., word games). There was a similar pattern of results for passenger and remote (cell phone) conversations. Finally, there were some small differences between simulator and field studies, though both exhibited costs in performance for cell phone use. CONCLUSION: We suggest that (a) there are significant costs to driver reactions to external hazards or events associated with cell phone use, (b) hands-free cell phones do not eliminate or substantially reduce these costs, and (c) different research methodologies or performance measures may underestimate these costs. APPLICATION: Potential applications of this research include the assessment of performance costs attributable to different types of cell phones, cell phone conversations, experimental measures, or methodologies.},

Methods: The scientific literature exploring the effects of these two types of cell phone use on driving and driving-related performance is reviewed here. Results: Our review shows that talking on the phone, regardless of phone type, has negative impacts on performance especially in detecting and identifying events. Performance while using a hands-free phone was rarely found to be better than when using a handheld phone. Some studies found that drivers compensate for the deleterious effects of cell phone use when using a handheld phone but neglect to do so when using a hands-free phone.

@article{Schlesewsky2004,
abstract = {One of the most basic assumptions regarding language comprehension is that it proceeds incrementally, i.e. by seeking to maximise the degree of interpretation computed with each new word that is encountered. This perspective has often been though to entail that the thematic interpretation of an argument may be derived from its grammatical function, for example, via a preference-strategy associating a subject with a Causer. In the present paper, we argue that these conclusions are not supported by experimental findings. Rather, as we show on the basis of a number of studies using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), the degree of meaning derived from a given sentence fragment (form) during online sentence comprehension differs as a function of the morphological informativeness of the sentential arguments. Finally, we present a new model of sentence comprehension, the Argument Dependency Model (ADM), which is designed to capture these differences in the way that meaning is computed incrementally. Specifically, the ADM assumes that argument processing proceeds via two alternative processing pathways, one of which is syntactic, and the other of which is thematic (interpretive) in nature. Whereas both pathways seek to establish hierarchical relations between arguments, only the thematic pathway allows for incremental interpretation to be maximised. Which of the two pathways is chosen during the comprehension of a given sentence crucially depends on the morphological informativeness (i.e. presence or absence of unambiguous morphological case marking) of the arguments. Consequences for language architecture arising from this model will be discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All right Reserved.},

Experiments comparing the ID3 symbolic learning algorithm with the perceptron and backpropagation neural learning algorithms have been performed using five large, real-world data sets. Overall, backpropagation performs slightly better than the other two algorithms in terms of classification accuracy on new examples, but takes much longer to train. Experimental results suggest that backpropagation can work significantly better on data sets containing numerical data. Also analyzed empirically are the effects of (1) the amount of training data, (2) imperfect training examples, and (3) the encoding of the desired outputs. Backpropagation occasionally outperforms the other two systems when given relatively small amounts of training data. It is slightly more accurate than ID3 when examples are noisy or incompletely specified. Finally, backpropagation more effectively utilizes a distributed output},

Adjustments in types are a feature of the compositional process and account for various phenomena including coercion and copredication.

abstract = {What makes people smarter than computers? The work described in these two volumes suggests that the answer lies in the massively parallel architecture of the human mind. It is some of the most exciting work in cognitive science, unifying neural and cognitive processes in a highly computational framework, with links to artificial intelligence. Although thought and problem solving have a sequential character when viewed over a time frame of minutes or hours, the authors argue that each step in the sequence is the result of the simultaneous activity of a large number of simple computational elements, each influencing others and being influenced by them. Parallel Distributed Processing describes their work in developing a theoretical framework for describing this parallel distributed processing activity and in applying the framework to the development of models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Volume 1 lays the theoretical foundations of parallel distributed processing. It introduces the approach and the reasons why the authors feel it is a fruitful one, describes several models of basic mechanisms with wide applicability to different problems, and presents a number of specific technical analyses of different aspects of parallel distributed models.},

abstract = {In learning the meanings of words, children are guided by a set of constraints that give privilege to some potential meanings over others. These word-learning constraints are sometimes viewed as part of a specifically linguistic endowment. However, several recent computational models suggest concretely how word-learning - constraints included - might emerge from more general aspects of cognition, such as associative learning, attention and rational inference. This article reviews these models, highlighting the link between general cognitive forces and the word-learning they subserve. Ultimately, these cognitive forces might leave their mark not just on language learning, but also on language itself: in constraining the space of possible meanings, they place limits on cross-linguistic semantic variation.},

abstract = {Introduction: While sentence comprehension has been reported to be defective in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), it is still unclear if this disorder reflects the presence of syntactic impairment, or may be attributed to other factors, such as executive or working memory dysfunction. In order to assess the status of syntactic knowledge in a group of patients belonging to the FTD spectrum, we investigated their ability to detect violations of Universal Grammar principles in a sentence judgement task. Methods: The group included four semantic dementia patients (SD), nine frontal variant of FTD patients (FvFTD), 15 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, and 11 corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS) patients. Their performance was compared to a group of 10 patients with mild probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and to 10 healthy volunteers. The patients underwent a standard aphasia test and a sentence comprehension test. The experimental study included five kinds of violations: semantic coherence (SC), verb-subject agreement (VSAgr), pronominalization involving clitic movement (ClM), interrogatives (WhS) and contrastive focus constructions (CFC). Results: The FTD patients performed within normal range in the aphasia test, and in the sentence comprehension test. Within the FTD subgroups, only patients with CBDS were significantly impaired in detecting three of the five kinds of violations. AD patients were also impaired in the detection of WhS and SC anomalies and in sentence comprehension. Discussion: The present findings indicate that, within the FTD spectrum, an impairment of syntactic knowledge can be found only in CBDS patients, even in the absence of clinical evidence of aphasia. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is argued that partially ordered quantifiers are often needed in the semantics of english and even that (equivalents to) all partially ordered quantifier structures are present in the semantical representations of suitable english quantifier sentences. This is remarkable because the theory of partially ordered quantifiers is as complex as the standard second-Order logic, As measured by the difficulty of their respective decision problems.},

@article{Partee1975,
abstract = {A theory of grammar (syntax {\&} semantics) is proposed combining the most essential feature of Richard Montague's theory of syntax {\&} semantics {\&} the transformational approach to syntax. The resulting theory is closer to Montague than to any of the current versions of transformational grammar; nevertheless, close analogues of most of the rules (both phrase structure {\&} transformational) formulated by transformationalists can be naturally included in the new theory. Montague's central working premise, carried over here, is that the syntactic rules determining how a sentence is built out of smaller syntactic parts should correspond 1-to-1 with the semantic rules telling how the meaning of a sentence is a function of the meanings of its parts. This idea is not new in either linguistics or philosophy - in philosophy it has its basis in the work of Frege, Tarski, {\&} Carnap; it is also standard in the treatment of formalized languages; {\&} in transformational grammar it can be found in Katz {\&} Fodor's earliest work on semantics (1963). However, with a few exceptions (e.g., Reichenbach, 1947), philosophers before Montague have applied this principle only to describing constructed languages {\&} have sometimes expressed skepticism as to whether natural languages would even admit of such a description. Linguists, on the other hand, have attempted to apply principles of syntactic-semantic correspondence to natural languages, but their definitions of semantic theory have diverged considerably from the philosophico-logical tradition. Alternative conceptions of semantics are proposed, {\&} the suggestion that there is no principled reason for linguists to eschew the philosophico-logical conception of semantics is proposed on the basis that there are in fact some good reasons for adopting it. The 2nd {\&} largest section of the article - primarily for linguists - is devoted to an explication of Montague's approach to syntax {\&} semantics. In the 3rd section - primarily addressed to philosophers - main features of transformational syntax {\&} problems raised in various attempts to add semantics to the theory are discussed. HA},

The usual kind of extensional semantics as based on: (1) letting terms denote the objects they name; (2) letting sentences denote truth values; and (3) letting expressions of all other categories stand for functions constructed from individuals and truth values. Probably the most general language of extensional logic, based on the most consequential exploitation of Frege's maneuver, was put forward by Alonzo under the name of the simple theory of types. The most famous system of modal predicate logic was presented by Richard. He called the system intensional logic and this term has been almost universally accepted. The basic idea was that of explicating intensions generally as functions from possible worlds to extensions. This was compatible with the relationship seen between the extension of a sentence and its Kripkean intension: the intension of a sentence could be seen as a function mapping each world on the truth value of the sentence for that world. This chapter elaborates on modal logic, modal predicate logic, and Montague's "locally" intensional logic. Concepts of "globally" intensional logic are explained. A discussion on Quine's extensionalist program is also presented in this chapter. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As robots become more ubiquitous, it is increasingly important for untrained users to be able to interact with them intuitively. In this work, we investigate how people refer to objects in the world during relatively unstructured communication with robots. We collect a corpus of deictic interactions from users describing objects, which we use to train language and gesture models that allow our robot to determine what objects are being indicated. We introduce a temporal extension to state-of-the-art hierarchical matching pursuit features to support gesture understanding, and demonstrate that combining multiple communication modalities more effectively capture user intent than relying on a single type of input. Finally, we present initial interactions with a robot that uses the learned models to follow commands.},

abstract = {Three experiments examined the hypothesis that it preferentially refers to the most salient entity in a discourse, whereas that preferentially refers to a conceptual composite. In Experiment 1, eye movements were monitored as participants followed spoken instructions such as, Put the cup on the saucer. Now put it/that.... The preferred referent was the theme (cup) for it and the composite for that (cup on the saucer) with the goal (saucer) rarely chosen. Experiment 2 demonstrated that stressing it reduces the number of theme interpretations. Experiment 3 replicated the main findings from Experiment 1, regardless of whether or not the theme was the backward-looking center. The authors conclude that entities without linguistic antecedents are sometimes preferred over entities with linguistic antecedents and a single construct such as salience is insufficient to account for differences among referential forms. Candidate reference-specific constructs include the availability of conceptual composites and syntactic role. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In development, children often use gesture to communicate before they use words. The question is whether these gestures merely precede language development or are fundamentally tied to it. We examined 10 children making the transition from single words to two-word combinations and found that gesture had a tight relation to the children's lexical and syntactic development. First, a great many of the lexical items that each child produced initially in gesture later moved to that child's verbal lexicon. Second, children who were first to produce gesture-plus-word combinations conveying two elements in a proposition (point at bird and say "nap") were also first to produce two-word combinations ("bird nap"). Changes in gesture thus not only predate but also predict changes in language, suggesting that early gesture may be paving the way for future developments in language.},

The age of pointing onset was established to within 2 weeks. Babies were also tested at monthly intervals on a number of tasks designed to study the relation between language acquisition, fine motor skills, handedness anddetour problem solving. Acquisition of fine motor control in the pincer grip precedes pointing. Girls pointed slightly before boys and age of pointing onset (ca 1 1.3 months) predicts both the number ofgestures produced and the number ofsounds comprehended at 14.4 months. Unimanual right-handed prob- lem solving sequences predict MacArthur gestures. Both the relative balance of fine motor activity between the hands, and collaborative bimanual activity with right-hand dominance, predict speech comprehension andspeech production at 14.4 months. Detour problem solving does not predict any of the language skills measured by the MacArthur test. These results suggest that onset of pointing may be linked both to gesture and to speech through developmental changes in cerebral dominance. It is possible that there are sex differences in this process.},

@phdthesis{LisonThesis2014,
abstract = {This thesis presents a new modelling framework for dialogue management based on the concept of probabilistic rules. Probabilistic rules are defined as if...then...else constructions associating logical conditions on input variables to probabilistic effects over output variables. These rules function as high-level templates for the generation of a directed graphical model. Their expressive power allows them to represent the probabilistic models employed in dialogue management in a compact and efficient manner. As a consequence, they can drastically reduce the amount of interaction data required for parameter estimation as well as enhance the system's ability to generalise over unseen situations. Furthermore, probabilistic rules can also be exploited to encode domain-specific constraints and assumptions into statistical models of dialogue, thereby enabling system designers to incorporate their expert knowledge of the problem structure in a concise and human-readable form. Due to their integration of logical and probabilistic reasoning, we argue that probabilistic rules are particularly well suited to devise hybrid models of dialogue management that can account for both the complexity and uncertainty that characterise many dialogue domains. The thesis also demonstrates how the parameters of probabilistic rules can be efficiently es- timated using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. In the case of supervised learning, the rule parameters are learned by imitation on the basis of small amounts of Wizard- of-Oz data. Alternatively, rule parameters can also be optimised via trial and error from repeated interactions with a (real or simulated) user. Both learning strategies rely on Bayesian inference to iteratively estimate the parameter values and provide the best fit for the observed interaction data. Three consecutive experiments conducted in a human–robot interaction domain attest to the practical viability of the proposed framework and its advantages over traditional approaches. In particular, the empirical results of a user evaluation with 37 participants show that a dialogue man- ager structured with probabilistic rules outperforms both purely hand-crafted and purely statistical methods on an extensive range of subjective and objective metrics of dialogue quality. The modelling framework presented in this thesis is implemented in a new software toolkit called OpenDial, which is made freely available to the research community and can be used to develop various types of dialogue systems based on probabilistic rules.},

The material on logic covers not only the standard statement logic and first-order predicate logic but includes an introduction to formal systems, axiomatization, and model theory. The section on algebra is presented with an emphasis on lattices as well as Boolean and Heyting algebras. Background for recent research in natural language semantics includes sections on lambda-abstraction and generalized quantifiers. Chapters on automata theory and formal languages contain a discussion of languages between context-free and context-sensitive and form the background for much current work in syntactic theory and computational linguistics. The many exercises not only reinforce basic skills but offer an entry to linguistic applications of mathematical concepts. For upper-level undergraduate students and graduate students in theoretical linguistics, computer-science students with interests in computational linguistics, logic programming and artificial intelligence, mathematicians and logicians with interests in linguistics and the semantics of natural language.},

abstract = {Whether computational algorithms such as latent semantic analysis can both extract meaning from language and advance theories of human cognition has become a topic of debate in cognitive science, whereby accounts of symbolic cognition and embodied cognition are often contrasted. Albeit for different reasons, in both accounts the importance of statistical regularities in linguistic surface structure tends to be underestimated. The current article gives an overview of the symbolic and embodied cognition accounts and shows how meaning induction attributed to a specific statistical process or to activation of embodied representations should be attributed to language itself. Specifically, the performance of LSA can be attributed to the linguistic surface structure, more than special characteristics of the algorithm, and embodiment findings attributed to perceptual simulations can be explained by distributional linguistic information.},

abstract = {We propose a mathematical framework for a unification of the distributional theory of meaning in terms of vector space models, and a compositional theory for grammatical types, for which we rely on the algebra of Pregroups, introduced by Lambek. This mathematical framework enables us to compute the meaning of a well-typed sentence from the meanings of its constituents. Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are ‘lifted' to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes howthe information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence. A variation of our ‘categorical model' which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in a Montague-style Boolean-valued semantics.},

abstract = {Inspired by recent advances in multimodal learning and machine translation, we introduce an encoder-decoder pipeline that learns (a): a multimodal joint embedding space with images and text and (b): a novel language model for decoding distributed representations from our space. Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - "blue" + "red" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison.},

The emphasis of the model is on the combination of individual word meanings to produce meanings for complex referring expressions. The model has been implemented, and it is able to understand a broad range of spatial referring expressions. We describe our implementation of word level visually-grounded semantics and their embedding in a compositional parsing framework. The implemented system selects the correct referents in response to natural language expressions for a large percentage of test cases. In an analysis of the system's successes and failures we reveal how visual context influences the semantics of utterances and propose future extensions to the model that take such context into account.},

Aimed at linguists, computer scientists, and logicians with an interest in the computation of meaning, this book focuses on two main topics in recent research in computational semantics. The first topic is the definition and use of underspecified semantic representations, i.e. formal structures that represent part of the meaning of a linguistic object while leaving other parts unspecified. The second topic discussed is semantic annotation. Annotated corpora have become an indispensable resource both for linguists and for developers of language and speech technology, especially when used in combination with machine learning methods. The annotation in corpora has only marginally addressed semantic information, however, since semantic annotation methodologies are still in their infancy. This book discusses the development and application of such methodologies.},

Distributional models have been successful in modelling the meanings of content words, but logical semantics is necessary to adequately represent many function words. We follow formal semantics in mapping language to logical representations, but differ in that the relational constants used are induced by offline distributional clustering at the level of predicate- argument structure. Our clustering algorithm is highly scalable, allowing us to run on corpora the size of Gigaword. Different senses of a word are disambiguated based on their induced types. We outperform a variety of existing approaches on a wide-coverage question answering task, and demonstrate the ability to make complex multi-sentence inferences involving quantifiers on the FraCaS suite.},

To un- derstand such a seemingly difficult signal, we propose to model the ambiguity inherent in acoustic signals and in lex- ical and grammatical choices using compact, probabilistic representations of multiple hypotheses. To resolve semantic ambiguities we propose a situation model that captures as- pects of the physical context of an utterance as well as the speaker's intentions, in our case represented by recognized plans. In a single, coherent Framework for Understanding Situated Speech (FUSS) we show how these two influences, acting on an ambiguous representation of the speech signal, complement each other to disambiguate form and content of situated speech. This method produces promising results in a game playing environment and leaves room for other types of situation models.},

The similarity between speakers' initial eye movements and those of observers performing a nonverbal event-comprehension task suggested that response-relevant information was rapidly extracted from scenes, allowing speakers to select grammatical subjects based on comprehended events rather than salience. When speaking extemporaneously, speakers began fixating pictured elements less than a second before naming them within their descriptions, a finding consistent with incremental lexical encoding. Eye movements anticipated the order of mention despite changes in picture orientation, in who-did-what-to-whom, and in sentence structure. The results support Wundt's theory of sentence production.},

abstract = {In a spoken dialog system, determining which action a machine should take in a given situation is a difficult problem because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Much of the research in spoken dialog systems centres on mitigating this uncertainty and recent work has focussed on three largely disparate techniques: parallel dialog state hypotheses, local use of confidence scores, and automated planning. While in isolation each of these approaches can improve action selection, taken together they currently lack a unified statistical framework that admits global optimization. In this paper we cast a spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show how this formulation unifies and extends existing techniques to form a single principled framework. A number of illustrations are used to show qualitatively the potential benefits of POMDPs compared to existing techniques, and empirical results from dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative gains. Finally, some of the key challenges to advancing this method - in particular scalability - are briefly outlined. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Comparison of generative and discriminative classifiers is an ever-lasting topic. As an important contribution to this topic, based on their theoretical and empirical comparisons between the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression, Ng and Jordan (NIPS 841-848, 2001) claimed that there exist two distinct regimes of performance between the generative and discriminative classifiers with regard to the training-set size. In this paper, our empirical and simulation studies, as a complement of their work, however, suggest that the existence of the two distinct regimes may not be so reliable. In addition, for real world datasets, so far there is no theoretically correct, general criterion for choosing between the discriminative and the generative approaches to classification of an observation x into a class y; the choice depends on the relative confidence we have in the correctness of the specification of either p(y vertical bar x) or p(x, y) for the data. This can be to some extent a demonstration of why Efron (J Am Stat Assoc 70(352):892-898, 1975) and O'Neill (J Am Stat Assoc 75(369):154-160, 1980) prefer normal-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) when no model mis-specification occurs but other empirical studies may prefer linear logistic regression instead. Furthermore, we suggest that pairing of either LDA assuming a common diagonal covariance matrix (LDA-A) or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression may not be perfect, and hence it may not be reliable for any claim that was derived from the comparison between LDA-A or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression to be generalised to all generative and discriminative classifiers.},

abstract = {The fundamental claim of this paper is that salience - both visual and linguistic - is an important overarching semantic category structuring visually situated discourse. Based on this we argue that computer systems attempting to model the evolving context of a visually situated discourse should integrate models of visual and linguistic salience within their natural language processing (NLP) framework. The paper highlights the importance of dynamically updating and interrelating visual and linguistic discourse context representations. To support our approach, we have developed a real-time, natural language virtual reality (NLVR) system (called LIVE, for Linguistic Interaction with Virtual Environments) that implements an NLP framework based on both visual and linguistic salience. Within this framework saliency information underpins two of the core subtasks of NLP: reference resolution and the generation of referring expressions. We describe the theoretical basis and architecture of the LIVE NLP framework and present extensive evaluation results comparing the system's performance with that of human participants in a number of experiments. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Although we take no stance on which position is to be accepted as final truth with respect to human categorisation and naming, we do point to theoretical constraints that make each position more or less likely and we make clear suggestions on what the best engineering solution would be.

According to most current theories, states in modality-specific systems for perception, action and emotion do not represent knowledge – rather, redescriptions of these states in amodal representational languages do. Increasingly, however, researchers report that re-enactments of states in modality-specific systems underlie conceptual processing. In behavioral experiments, perceptual and motor variables consistently produce effects in conceptual tasks. In brain imaging experiments, conceptual processing consistently activates modality-specific brain areas. Theoretical research shows how modality-specific re-enactments could produce basic conceptual functions, such as the type–token distinction, categorical inference, productivity, propositions and abstract concepts. Together these empirical results and theoretical analyses implicate modality-specific systems in the representation and use of conceptual knowledge.},

Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of 1-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes).

abstract = {There are many studies that use color space models (CSM) for detection of faces in an image. Most researchers a priori select a given CSM, and proceed to use the selected model for color segmentation of the face by constructing a color distribution model (CDM). There is limited work on finding the overall best CSM. We develop a procedure to adaptively change the CSM throughout the processing of a video. We show that this works in environments where the face moves through multi-positioned light sources with varying types of illumination. A test of the procedure using the 2D color space models; RG, rg, HS, YQ and CbCr found that switching between the color spaces resulted in increased tracking performance. In addition, we have proposed a new performance measure for evaluating color-tracking algorithms, which include both accuracy and robustness of the tracking window. The methodology developed can be used to find the optimal CSM-CDM combination in adaptive color tracking systems.},

@article{Canny,
abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

@article{harnard:grounding,
abstract = {There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the "symbol grounding problem": How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g. "An X is a Y that is Z"). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic "module," however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically "dedicated" symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

This paper focuses on eye gaze and its combination with speech. We develop a model that resolves references to visual (screen) elements in a conversational web browsing system. The system detects eye gaze, recognizes speech, and then interprets the user's browsing intent (e.g., click on a specific element) through a combination of spoken language understanding and eye gaze tracking. We experiment with multi-turn interactions collected in a wizard-of-Oz scenario where users are asked to perform several web-browsing tasks. We compare several gaze features and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with speech-based lexical features. The resulting multi-modal system not only increases user intent (turn) accuracy by 17{\{}{\%}{\}}, but also resolves the referring expression ambiguity commonly observed in dialog systems with a 10{\{}{\%}{\}} increase in F-measure.},

abstract = {We present the results of a study of definite descriptions use in written texts aimed at assessing the feasibility of annotating corpora with information about definite description interpretation. We ran two experiments, in which subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in a corpus of 33 newspaper articles, containing a total of 1412 definite descriptions. We measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite descriptions, as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in the text. The most interesting result of this study from a corpus annotation perspective was the rather low agreement (K=0.63) that we obtained using versions of Hawkins' and Prince's classification schemes; better results (K=0.76) were obtained using the simplified scheme proposed by Fraurud that includes only two classes, first-mention and subsequent-mention. The agreement about antecedents was also not complete. These findings raise questions concerning the strategy of evaluating systems for definite description interpretation by comparing their results with a standardized annotation. From a linguistic point of view, the most interesting observations were the great number of discourse-new definites in our corpus (in one of our experiments, about 50{\%} of the definites in the collection were classified as discourse-new, 30{\%} as anaphoric, and 18{\%} as associative/bridging) and the presence of definites which did not seem to require a complete disambiguation.},

abstract = {An important aspect of the interpretation of multimodal messages is the ability to identify when the same object in the world is the referent of symbols in different modalities. To understand the caption of a picture, for instance, one needs to identify the graphical symbols that are referred to by names and pronouns in the natural language text. One way to think of this problem is in terms oft he notion of anaphora; however, unlike linguistic anaphoric inference, in which antecedents for pronouns are selected from a linguistic context, in the interpretation of the textual part of multimodal messages the antecedents ave selected from a graphical context. Under this view, resolving multimodal references is like resolving anaphora across modalities. Another way to see the same problem is to look at pronouns in texts about drawings as deictic. In this second view, the context of interpretation of a natural language term is defined asa set of expressions of a graphical language with well-defined syntax and semantics. Natural language and graphical terms are thought of as standing in a relation of translation similar to the translation relation that holds between natural languages. In this paper a theory based on this second view is presented. In this theory, the relations between multimodal representation and spatial deixis, on the one hand, and multimodal reasoning and deictic inference, on the other, are discussed. An integrated model of anaphoric and deictic resolution in the context of the interpretation of multimodal discourse is also advanced."},

We developed and tested a “situationally-aware” dialogue system that can interrupt its speech when a situation which requires more attention from the driver is detected, and can resume when driving conditions return to normal. Furthermore, our system allows driver-controlled resumption of in- terrupted speech via verbal or visual cues (head nods).

We perform extensive experimentation by comparing different tree-based kernels with a variety of representations of the available linguistic information, including semantic concepts, words, POS tags, shallow and full syntax, and discourse trees. The results show that the structured representation with the semantic concepts yields significant improvement over the base CSL parser, much larger compared to learning with an explicit feature vector representation.

We review five experiments showing that this time-locked characteristic of eye movements provides a detailed profile of the processes that underlie real-time spoken language comprehension. Together, the first four experiments showed that listeners immediately integrated lexical, sublexical, and prosodic information in the spoken input with information from the visual context to reduce the set of referents to the intended one. The fifth experiment demonstrated that a visual referential context affected the initial structuring of the linguistic input, eliminating even strong syntactic preferences that result in clear garden paths when the referential context is introduced linguistically. We argue that context affected the earliest moments of language processing because it was highly accessible and relevant to the behavioral goals of the listener.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To retrospectively assess, with three-dimensional rotational angiography, the relationship between packing, complex coils, and angiographic recurrence of aneurysms treated with coils. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent was waived by the institutional review board that approved the study. Results at follow-up angiography of 255 aneurysms in 223 patients (161 female and 62 male patients; mean age, 48 years) were dichotomized into presence or absence of recurrence. The degree of packing of aneurysms treated with complex coils alone, with complex and helical coils, and with helical coils only was compared for significant differences. With generalized estimating equations analysis, relative risk (RR) for recurrence was calculated for mode of manifestation, duration of follow-up, aneurysm volume, packing, initial angiographic result, percentage of complex coils, aneurysm location, and multiplicity of aneurysms. RESULTS: Follow-up angiography revealed recurrence in 28.6{\%} of aneurysms at a mean follow-up of 12 months; 5.5{\%} were amenable to re-treatment. Aneurysms treated with complex and those treated with helical coils only had a mean packing of 27{\%} and 26{\%}, respectively. There was no significant difference between packing of aneurysms treated with complex and those treated with helical coils (P = .538). Recurring and stable aneurysms both had a mean packing of 27{\%}. Generalized estimating equations analysis showed significant differences between duration of follow-up and recurrence (P = .001, RR = 3.39), between aneurysm volume and recurrence (P {\textless} .001, RR = 6.15), and between hemorrhagic manifestation and recurrence (P = .002, RR = 3.17). There was no significant difference between packing and recurrence, between initial angiographic result and recurrence, between percentage of complex coils and recurrence, between aneurysm location and recurrence, or between multiplicity of aneurysms and recurrence. CONCLUSION: More angiographic recurrences are detected over time. Complex coils do not augment aneurysm packing. Packing is not related to protection against recurrence.},

abstract = {This paper describes the functioning of a broad-coverage probabilistic top-down parser, and its application to the problem of language modeling for speech recognition. The paper first introduces key notions in language modeling and probabilistic parsing, and briefly reviews some previous approaches to using syntactic structure for language modeling. A lexicalized probabilistic top-down parser is then presented, which performs very well, in terms of both the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found, relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers. A new language model which utilizes probabilistic top-down parsing is then outlined, and empirical results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity. Interpolation with a trigram model yields an exceptional improvement relative to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by a trigram model. A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility of the model.},

The model is introduced both informally and formally, and is applied to a range of languages. Alongside formal definitions, the authors use step-by-step derivations and detailed lexical definitions to illustrate this new form of syntactic analysis and to show how the model can be applied to a broad range of languages. In this way, the reader gets a sense of the rich potential the framework provides for general application to linguistic analysis. In bringing together explanations of knowledge of language, and the way language is used in parsing, the book challenges basic assumptions of linguistic theory, and is an essential read for anyone interested in what it means to know a language.},

@book{Steedman2000,
abstract = {In this book Mark Steedman argues that the surface syntax of natural languages maps spoken and written forms directly to a compositional semantic representation that includes predicate-argument structure, quantification, and information structure without constructing any intervening structural representation. His purpose is to construct a principled theory of natural grammar that is directly compatible with both explanatory linguistic accounts of a number of problematic syntactic phenomena and a straightforward computational account of the way sentences are mapped onto representations of meaning. The radical nature of Steedman's proposal stems from his claim that much of the apparent complexity of syntax, prosody, and processing follows from the lexical specification of the grammar and from the involvement of a small number of universal rule-types for combining predicates and arguments. These syntactic operations are related to the combinators of Combinatory Logic, engendering a much freer definition of derivational constituency than is traditionally assumed. This property allows Combinatory Categorial Grammar to capture elegantly the structure and interpretation of coordination and intonation contour in English as well as some well-known interactions between word order, coordination, and relativization across a number of other languages. It also allows more direct compatibility with incremental semantic interpretation during parsing.The book covers topics in formal linguistics, intonational phonology, computational linguistics, and experimental psycholinguistics, presenting them as an integrated theory of the language faculty in a form accessible to readers from any of those fields.},

In this work, we investigate how people refer to objects in the world during relatively unstructured communication with robots.

We introduce a temporal extension to state-of-the-art hierarchical matching pursuit features to support gesture understanding, and demonstrate that combining multiple communication modalities more effectively capture user intent than relying on a single type of input.

abstract = {As robots collaborate with humans in increasingly diverse environments, they will need to effectively refer to objects of joint interest and adapt their references to various physical, environmental, and task conditions. Humans use a broad range of deictic gestures-gestures that direct attention to collocated objects, persons, or spaces-that include pointing, touching, and exhibiting to help their listeners understand their references. These gestures offer varying levels of support under different conditions, making some gestures more or less suitable for different settings. While these gestures offer a rich space for designing communicative behaviors for robots, a better understanding of how different deictic gestures affect communication under different conditions is critical for achieving effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we seek to build such an understanding by implementing six deictic gestures on a humanlike robot and evaluating their communicative effectiveness in six diverse settings that represent physical, environmental, and task conditions under which robots are expected to employ deictic communication. Our results show that gestures which come into physical contact with the object offer the highest overall communicative accuracy and that specific settings benefit from the use of particular types of gestures. Our results highlight the rich design space for deictic gestures and inform how robots might adapt their gestures to the specific physical, environmental, and task conditions.},

It is based on a spatial knowledge base encompassing both robot- and human-centric representations. Existing algorithms for the generation of referring expres- sions (GRE) try to find a description that uniquely identifies the referent with respect to other enti- ties that are in the current context. Mobile robots, however, act in large-scale space, that is, environ- ments that are larger than what can be perceived at a glance, e.g., an office building with different floors, each containing several rooms and objects. One challenge when referring to elsewhere is thus to in- clude enough information so that the interlocutors can extend their context appropriately. We address this challenge with a method for context construc- tion that can be used for both generating and resolv- ing REs – two previously disjoint aspects. Our ap- proach is embedded in a bi-directional framework for natural language processing for robots.},

abstract = {We report a new phenomenon associated with language comprehension: the action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE). Participants judged whether sentences were sensible by making a response that required moving toward or away from their bodies. When a sentence implied action in one direction (e.g., "Close the drawer" implies action away from the body), the participants had difficulty making a sensibility judgment requiring a response in the opposite direction. The ACE was demonstrated for three sentences types: imperative sentences, sentences describing the transfer of concrete objects, and sentences describing the transfer of abstract entities, such as "Liz told you the story." These dataare inconsistent with theories of language comprehension in which meaning is represented as a set of relations among nodes. Instead, the data support an embodied theory of meaning that relates the meaning of sentences to human action.},

abstract = {Previous work on Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) shows that these models can produce compositional feature vectors for accurately representing and classifying sentences or images. However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image.},

We then introduce fast mapping, a challenging and more cognitively plausi- ble variant of the zero-shot task, in which the learner is exposed to new objects and the corresponding words in very limited linguistic contexts. By combining prior linguistic and visual knowledge acquired about words and their objects, as well as exploiting the limited new evidence avail- able, the learner must learn to associate new objects with words. Our results on this task pave the way to realistic simula- tions of how children or robots could use existing knowledge to bootstrap grounded semantic knowledge about new concepts. 1},

abstract = {Unsupervised machine learning approaches hold great promise for recognizing dialogue acts, but the performance of these models tends to be much lower than the accuracies reached by supervised models. However, some dialogues, such as task-oriented dialogues with parallel task streams, hold rich information that has not yet been leveraged within unsupervised dialogue act models. This paper investigates incorporating task features into an unsupervised dialogue act model trained on a corpus of human tutoring in introductory computer science. Experimental results show that incorporating task features and dialogue history features significantly improve unsupervised dialogue act classification, particularly within a hierarchical framework that gives prominence to dialogue history. This work constitutes a step toward building high-performing unsupervised dialogue act models that will be used in the next generation of task-oriented dialogue systems.},

Although discriminative models are gaining popularity due to their superior performance, generative models based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process model still remain at-tractive since they provide an integrated framework for dialog state tracking and dialog policy optimization. Although a straightforward way to fit a generative model is to independently train the com-ponent probability models, we present a gradient descent algorithm that simultane-ously train all the component models. We show that the resulting tracker performs competitively with other top-performing trackers that participated in DSTC2.},

abstract = {In a spoken dialog system, dialog state tracking deduces information about the user's goal as the dialog progresses, syn-thesizing evidence such as dialog acts over multiple turns with external data sources. Recent approaches have been shown to overcome ASR and SLU errors in some applications. However, there are currently no common testbeds or evaluation mea-sures for this task, hampering progress. The dialog state tracking challenge seeks to address this by providing a heteroge-neous corpus of 15K human-computer di-alogs in a standard format, along with a suite of 11 evaluation metrics. The chal-lenge received a total of 27 entries from 9 research groups. The results show that the suite of performance metrics cluster into 4 natural groups. Moreover, the dialog sys-tems that benefit most from dialog state tracking are those with less discriminative speech recognition confidence scores. Fi-nally, generalization is a key problem: in 2 of the 4 test sets, fewer than half of the entries out-performed simple baselines.},

abstract = {Over the last years, the robotics community has made substantial progress in detection and 3D pose estimation of known and unknown objects. However, the question of how to identify objects based on language descriptions has not been investigated in detail. While the computer vision community recently started to investigate the use of attributes for object recognition, these approaches do not consider the task settings typically observed in robotics, where a combination of appearance attributes and object names might be used in referral language to identify specific objects in a scene. In this paper, we introduce an approach for identifying objects based on natural language containing appearance and name attributes. To learn rich RGB-D features needed for attribute classification, we extend recently introduced sparse coding techniques so as to automatically learn attribute-dependent features. We introduce a large data set of attribute descriptions of objects in the RGB-D object dataset. Experiments on this data set demonstrate the strong performance of our approach to language based object identification. We also show that our attribute-dependent features provide significantly better generalization to previously unseen attribute values, thereby enabling more rapid learning of new attribute values.},

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (ldquospotty dogrdquo, not just ldquodogrdquo); to say something about unfamiliar objects (ldquohairy and four-leggedrdquo, not just ldquounknownrdquo); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (ldquospottyrdquo) or discriminative (ldquodogs have it but sheep do notrdquo). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.},

abstract = {For people to contribute to discourse, they must do more than utter the right sentence at the right time. The basic requirement is that they add to their common ground in an orderly way. To do this, we argue, they try to establish for each utterance the mutual belief that the addressees have understood what the speaker meant well enough for current purposes. This is accomplished by the collective actions of the current contributor and his or her partners, and these result in units of conversation called contributions. We present a model of contributions and show how it accounts for a variety of features of everyday conversations. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Abstract-Contributing to conversation, it is proposed, is accomplished in two phases. In the presentation phase, one participant ordinarily presents a stretch of speech intended to specify the content of his or her contribution. In the acceptance phase, all the participants work together to establish the mutual belief that everyone else has understood that content well enough for current purposes. The two phases together constitute a unit of conversation we call a contribution. The two phases may each have contributions embedded within them, so conversations consist of both sequential and hierarchical arrangements of contributions. As evidence for these proposals, we examine four types of contributions that occurred in directory enquiries of the telephone company. From this and other evidence, we argue that contributions appear to be a general feature of conversations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a computational model of how conversational participants collaborate in order to make a referring action successful. The model is based on the view of language as goal-directed behavior. We propose that the content of a referring expression can be accounted for by the planning paradigm. Not only does this approach allow the processes of building referring expressions and identifying their referents to be captured by plan construction and plan inference, it also allows us to account for how participants clarify a referring expression by using meta-actions that reason about and manipulate the plan derivation that corresponds to the referring expression. To account for how clarification goals arise and how inferred clarification plans affect the agent, we propose that the agents are in a certain state of mind, and that this state includes an intention to achieve the goal of referring and a plan that the agents are currently considering. It is this mental state that sanctions the adoption of goals and the acceptance of inferred plans, and so acts as a link between understanding and generation.},

abstract = {We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets, focusing on the specific case of segmented images with associated text. Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data.},

abstract = {Multimodal conversational interfaces allow users to carry a dialog with a graphical display using speech to accomplish a particular task. Motivated by previous psycholinguistic findings, we examine how eye-gaze contributes to reference resolution in such a setting. Specifically, we present an integrated probabilistic framework that combines speech and eye-gaze for reference resolution. We further examine the relationship between eyegaze and increased domain modeling with corresponding linguistic processing. Our empirical results show that the incorporation of eye-gaze significantly improves reference resolution performance. This improvement is most dramatic when a simple domain model is used. Our results also show that minimal domain modeling combined with eye-gaze significantly outperforms complex domain modeling without eye-gaze, which indicates that eye-gaze can be used to potentially compensate a lack of domain modeling for reference resolution.},

abstract = {Being able to detect and recognize human activities is important for making personal assistant robots useful in performing assistive tasks. The challenge is to develop a system that is low-cost, reliable in unstructured home settings, and also straightforward to use. In this paper, we use a RGBD sensor (Microsoft Kinect) as the input sensor, and present learning algorithms to infer the activities. Our algorithm is based on a hierarchical maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM).

abstract = {Recursive structure is commonly found in the inputs of different modalities such as natural scene images or natural language sentences. Discovering this recursive structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure prediction architecture based on recursive neural networks that can successfully recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classification. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1{\%}). The features from the image parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4{\%}.},

Recently, this has led to study of the lan- guage grounding problem, where the goal is to extract representations of the mean- ings of natural language tied to the physi- cal world. We present an approach for joint learning of language and perception models for grounded attribute induction. The per- ception model includes classifiers for phys- ical characteristics and a language model based on a probabilistic categorial grammar that enables the construction of composi- tional meaning representations.

abstract = {Open-ended spoken interactions are typi- cally characterised by both structural com- plexity and high levels of uncertainty, making dialogue management in such set- tings a particularly challenging problem. Traditional approaches have focused on providing theoretical accounts for either the uncertainty or the complexity of spo- ken dialogue, but rarely considered the two issues simultaneously. This paper de- scribes ongoing work on a new approach to dialogue management which attempts to fill this gap. We represent the interac- tion as a Partially Observable Markov De- cision Process (POMDP) over a rich state space incorporating both dialogue, user, and environment models. The tractability of the resulting POMDP can be preserved using a mechanism for dynamically con- straining the action space based on prior knowledge over locally relevant dialogue structures. These constraints are encoded in a small set of general rules expressed as a Markov Logic network. The first-order expressivity of Markov Logic enables us to leverage the rich relational structure of the problem and efficiently abstract over large regions of the state and action spaces.},

Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntac- tic and semantic content. Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model.

A small post-hoc analysis further suggests that, when the model-generated AN vector is not similar to the corpus-observed AN vector, this is due to anomalies in the latter. We show more-over that our approach provides two novel ways to represent adjective meanings, alternative to its representation via corpus-based co-occurrence vectors, both outperforming the latter in an adjective clustering task.},

Instead, we model meaning with latent variables, and introduce a loss function to measure how well potential meanings match the conversation. This loss drives the overall learning approach, which in- duces a weighted CCG grammar that could be used to automatically bootstrap the semantic analysis component in a complete dialog sys- tem. Experiments on DARPA Communica- tor conversational logs demonstrate effective learning, despite requiring no explicit mean- ing annotations.},

abstract = {Gaze aversion-the intentional redirection away from the face of an interlocutor-is an important nonverbal cue that serves a number of conversational functions, including signaling cognitive effort, regulating a conversation's intimacy level, and managing the conversational floor. In prior work, we developed a model of how gaze aversions are employed in conversation to perform these functions. In this paper, we extend the model to apply to conversational robots, enabling them to achieve some of these functions in conversations with people. We present a system that addresses the challenges of adapting human gaze aversion movements to a robot with very different affordances, such as a lack of articulated eyes. This system, implemented on the NAO platform, autonomously generates and combines three distinct types of robot head movements with different purposes: face-tracking movements to engage in mutual gaze, idle head motion to increase lifelikeness, and purposeful gaze aversions to achieve conversational functions. The results of a human-robot interaction study with 30 participants show that gaze aversions implemented with our approach are perceived as intentional, and robots can use gaze aversions to appear more thoughtful and effectively manage the conversational floor.},

abstract = {In order to communicate with their users in a natural and effective manner, humanlike robots must seamlessly integrate behaviors across multiple modalities, including speech, gaze, and gestures. While researchers and designers have successfully drawn on studies of human interactions to build models of humanlike behavior and to achieve such integration in robot behavior, the development of such models involves a laborious process of inspecting data to identify patterns within each modality or across modalities of behavior and to represent these patterns as "rules" or heuristics that can be used to control the behaviors of a robot, but provides little support for validation, extensibility, and learning. In this paper, we explore how a learning-based approach to modeling multimodal behaviors might address these limitations. We demonstrate the use of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for modeling how humans coordinate speech, gaze, and gesture behaviors in narration and for achieving such coordination with robots. The evaluation of this approach in a human-robot interaction study shows that this learning-based approach is comparable to conventional modeling approaches in enabling effective robot behaviors while reducing the effort involved in identifying behavioral patterns and providing a probabilistic representation of the dynamics of human behavior. We discuss the implications of this approach for designing natural, effective multimodal robot behaviors.},

abstract = {In situated human-robot dialogue, although humans and robots are co-present in a shared environment, they have significantly mismatched capabilities in perceiving the shared environment. Their representations of the shared world are misaligned. In order for humans and robots to communicate with each other successfully using language, it is important for them to mediate such differences and to establish common ground. To address this issue, this paper describes a dialogue system that aims to mediate a shared perceptual basis during human-robot dialogue. In particular, we present an empirical study that examines the role of the robot's collaborative effort and the performance of natural language processing modules in dialogue grounding. Our empirical results indicate that in situated human-robot dialogue, a low collaborative effort from the robot may lead its human partner to believe a common ground is established. However, such beliefs may not reflect true mutual understanding. To support truly grounded dialogues, the robot should make an extra effort by making its partner aware of its internal representation of the shared world.},

We describe experiments using the Let's Go data that show an improvement in classification accuracy (+5{\%}) in Bayesian dialogue act recognition involving barge-ins using partial context compared to using full context.

@book{ginzburg2012interactive,
abstract = {The fine structure of conversational interaction is of significant interest for wide swathes of the behavioural sciences: linguists, philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, literary scholars, artificial intelligence researchers must all contend with issues relating to the nature of meaning and its sharing among interlocuters, the possibility of repair — the wide range of corrective actions that occur when ‘trouble' arises in interaction — and the characterization of coherence in interaction. This book presents the results of attempting to create a precise, grammatically rooted, theory of conversation motivated by data from real conversations. It develops KoS, one of the most detailed theories of context in conversation, and uses this to analyze a variety of linguistic constructions characteristic of spoken interaction, many of which have not been previously analyzed formally. KoS has descriptive reach from the micro-conversational (e.g., self-repair at the word level) to macro-level phenomena such as multi-party conversation and the characterization of distinct conversational genres. It draws on extensive corpus studies of the British National Corpus, on evidence from language acquisition, and on computer simulations of language evolution. KoS provides accounts of the opening, middle game, and closing stages of conversation. KoS also offers a new perspective on traditional semantic concerns such as quantification and anaphora. It suggests a new methodological criterion — stronger than traditional compositionality — regulating allowable semantic denotations. All in all, KoS provides a highly detailed theory of relevance, taking in the illocutionary, metacommunicative, metadiscursive, and genre-based components of this complex notion. This book challenges orthodox views of grammar by arguing that grammar and interaction are intrinsically bound. It argues that, unless we wish to exclude from analysis a large body of frequently occurring words and constructions, the right way to construe grammar is as a system that characterizes types of talk in interaction.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to enable the construction of artificial conversational agents capable of working in a multi-party setting. By an artificial conversational agent we mean a software agent (possibly with embodiment, personality etc.), capable of engaging in conversation with other conversational agents (human or artificial). By a multi-party setting we mean that more than two agents are engaged in the communication or dialogue. Components designed for two-party dialogue management including sequencing and turn management cannot, in general, handle multi-party dialogue phenomena, such as keeping track of the obligations regarding turn management and the rights and obligations to address an issue. We present an SCXML implementation of Issue-Based Dialogue Management, scaled up to handle more than two participants. The QUD-based dialogue manager makes a distinction between distributive questions (to be answered individually by each addressee) and collective questions (to be answered by the addressees collectively), in order to provide the right kind of grounding behaviour and in order to manage correctly the obligations put on the participants of the dialogue. The dialogue manager also features an SCXML implementation of the SSJ turn management model. We find that it is possible to scale up the Issue-Based Dialogue Management model from twoparty to multi-party dialogues, given that distributive and collective readings of questions can be identified.},

These systems are expensive to develop and they suffer from significant degradation in performance when faced with recognition errors. This paper presents a robust method for SLU based on features extracted from the full posterior distribution of recognition hypotheses encoded in the form of word confusion networks. Following [1], the system uses SVM classifiers operating on n-gram features, trained on unaligned input/output pairs. Performance is evaluated on both an off-line corpus and on-line in a live user trial. It is shown that a statistical discriminative approach to SLU operating on the full posterior ASR output distribution can substantially improve performance both in terms of accuracy and overall dialogue reward. Furthermore, additional gains can be obtained by incorporating features from the previous system output.},

abstract = {Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process. We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and overtly naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly complex. The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes this process as staged and feed-forward. After a first stage of conceptual preparation, word generation proceeds through lexical selection, morphological and phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself. In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring of self-produced internal and overt speech. The core of the theory, ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is captured in a computational model, called WEAVER++. Both the theory and the computational model have been developed in interaction with reaction time experiments, particularly in picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production. A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The model can handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors (the major empirical domain for most other theories of lexical access), and the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.},

This research is reviewed and related to measures of abilities operationalized in existing aptitude tests, as well as to measures of abilities that are the focus of more recent research in cognitive psychology. Finally, prospects for developing aptitude tests to serve the purposes of predicting both early and advanced level language learning success are discussed in the light of the SLA findings and aptitude frameworks reviewed.},

Recent approaches have been shown to overcome ASR and SLU errors in some applications. However, there are currently no common testbeds or evaluation mea-sures for this task, hampering progress. The dialog state tracking challenge seeks to address this by providing a heteroge-neous corpus of 15K human-computer di-alogs in a standard format, along with a suite of 11 evaluation metrics. The chal-lenge received a total of 27 entries from 9 research groups. The results show that the suite of performance metrics cluster into 4 natural groups. Moreover, the dialog sys-tems that benefit most from dialog state tracking are those with less discriminative speech recognition confidence scores. Fi-nally, generalization is a key problem: in 2 of the 4 test sets, fewer than half of the entries out-performed simple baselines.},

We have analysed the participants' subjective rating, task completion, verbal responses, gaze behaviour, drawing activity, and cognitive load. The results show that users utilise the robot�s gaze in order to disambiguate referring expressions and manage the flow of the interaction.

In natural language tutorial dialogue, student dialogue moves hold important information about knowledge and goals, and are therefore an integral part of providing adaptive tutoring. Automatically classifying these dialogue acts is a challenging task, traditionally addressed with supervised classification techniques requiring substantial manual time and effort. There is growing interest in unsupervised dialogue act classification to address this limitation. This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework, query-likelihood clustering, for classifying student dialogue acts. This framework combines automated natural language processing with clustering and a novel adaptation of an information retrieval technique. Evaluation against manually labeled dialogue acts on a tutorial dialogue corpus in the domain of introductory computer science demonstrates that the proposed technique outperforms existing approaches. The results indicate that this technique holds promise for automatically understanding corpora of tutorial dialogue and for building adaptive dialogue systems.},

We include features of ASR systems and desiderata and re-quirements for different dialogue systems, taking into account the dialogue genre, type of user, and other features. We then present speech recognition results for six different dialogue systems. The most in-teresting result is that different ASR sys-tems perform best on the data sets. We also show that there is an improvement over a previous generation of recognizers on some of these data sets. We also inves-tigate language understanding (NLU) on the ASR output, and explore the relation-ship between ASR and NLU performance.},

abstract = {Traditional dialogue systems use a fixed silence threshold to detect the end of users' turns. Such a simplistic model can result in system behaviour that is both interruptive and unresponsive, which in turn affects user experience. Various studies have observed that human interlocutors take cues from speaker behaviour, such as prosody, syntax, and gestures, to coordinate smooth exchange of speaking turns. However, little effort has been made towards implementing these models in dialogue systems and verifying how well they model the turn-taking behaviour in human-computer interactions. We present a data-driven approach to building models for online detection of suitable feedback response locations in the user's speech. We first collected human-computer interaction data using a spoken dialogue system that can perform the Map Task with users (albeit using a trick). On this data, we trained various models that use automatically extractable prosodic, contextual and lexico-syntactic features for detecting response locations. Next, we implemented a trained model in the same dialogue system and evaluated it in interactions with users. The subjective and objective measures from the user evaluation confirm that a model trained on speaker behavioural cues offers both smoother turn-transitions and more responsive system behaviour. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and joint training of deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep architectures. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.},

We do this by predicting friendship status in a dyad using a set of automatically harvested verbal and nonverbal features from videos of the interaction of students in a peer tutoring study. We propose a new computational model used to model friendship status in our data, based on a group sparse model (GSM) with L2,1 norm which is designed to accommodate the sparse and noisy properties of the multi-channel features. Our GSM model achieved the best overall performance compared to a non-sparse linear model (NLM) and a regular sparse linear model (SLM), as well as outperforming human raters. Dyadic features, such as number and length of conversational turns and mutual gaze, in addition to low level features such as F0 and gaze at task, were found to be good predictors of friendship status.},

abstract = {Computers understand very little of the meaning of human language. This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.},

Indeed, it can be argued that the most frequent behaviour of human beings is movement of the eyes (Bridgeman, 1992). This ceaseless twitching, as one early researcher described it (Stratton, 1906), is the visual systems solution to the huge amount of available visual information and limited processing resources. The human eye covers a visual field of about 200 , but receives detailed information from only 2 (Levi, Klein, {\&} Aitsebaomo, 1985).},

abstract = {When participants follow spoken instructions to pick up and move objects in a visual workspace, their eye movements to the objects are closely time-locked to referential expressions in the instructions. Two experiments used this methodology to investigate the processing of the temporary ambiguities that arise because spoken language unfolds over time. Experiment 1 examined the processing of sentences with a temporarily ambiguous prepositional phrase (e.g., "Put the apple on the towel in the box") using visual contexts that supported either the normally preferred initial interpretation (the apple should be put on the towel) or the less-preferred interpretation (the apple is already on the towel and should be put in the box). Eye movement patterns clearly established that the initial interpretation of the ambiguous phrase was the one consistent with the context. Experiment 2 replicated these results using prerecorded digitized speech to eliminate any possibility of prosodic differences across conditions or experimenter demand. Overall, the findings are consistent with a broad theoretical framework in which real-time language comprehension immediately takes into account a rich array of relevant nonlinguistic context. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

@phdthesis{Pfeiffer2010,
abstract = {When humans communicate, we use deictic expressions to refer to objects in our surrounding and put them in the context of our actions. In face to face interaction, we can complement verbal expressions with gestures and, hence, we do not need to be too precise in our verbal protocols. Our interlocutors hear our speaking; see our gestures and they even read our eyes. They interpret our deictic expressions, try to identify the referents and – normally – they will understand. If only machines could do alike. The driving vision behind the research in this thesis are multimodal conversational interfaces where humans are engaged in natural dialogues with computer systems. The embodied conversational agent Max developed in the A.I. group at Bielefeld University is an example of such an interface. Max is already able to produce multimodal deictic expressions using speech, gaze and gestures, but his capabilities to understand humans are not on par. If he was able to resolve multimodal deictic expressions, his understanding of humans would increase and interacting with him would become more natural. Following this vision, we as scientists are confronted with several challenges. First, accurate models for human pointing have to be found. Second, precise data on multimodal interactions has to be collected, integrated and analyzed in order to create these models. This data is multimodal (transcripts, voice and video recordings, annotations) and not directly accessible for analysis (voice and video recordings). Third, technologies have to be developed to support the integration and the analysis of the multimodal data. Fourth, the created models have to be implemented, evaluated and optimized until they allow a natural interaction with the conversational interface. To this ends, this work aims to deepen our knowledge of human non-verbal deixis, specifically of manual and gaze pointing, and to apply this knowledge in conversational interfaces. At the core of the theoretical and empirical investigations of this thesis are models for the interpretation of pointing gestures to objects. These models address the following questions: When are we pointing? Where are we pointing to? Which objects are we pointing at? With respect to these questions, this thesis makes the following three contributions: First, gaze-based interaction technology for 3D environments: Gaze plays an important role in human communication, not only in deictic reference. Yet, technology for gaze interaction is still less developed than technology for manual interaction. In this thesis, we have developed components for real-time tracking of eye movements and of the point of regard in 3D space and integrated them in a framework for Deictic Reference In Virtual Environments (DRIVE). DRIVE provides viable information about human communicative behavior in real-time. This data can be used to investigate and to design processes on higher cognitive levels, such as turn-taking, check-backs, shared attention and resolving deictic reference. Second, data-driven modeling: We answer the theoretical questions about timing, direction, accuracy and dereferential power of pointing by data-driven modeling. As empirical basis for the simulations, we created a substantial corpus with highprecision data from an extensive study on multimodal pointing. Two further studies complemented this effort with substantial data on gaze pointing in 3D. Based on this data, we have developed several models of pointing and successfully created a model for the interpretation of manual pointing that achieves a human-like performance level. Third, new methodologies for research on multimodal deixis in the fields of linguistics and computer science: The experimental-simulative approach to modeling – which we follow in this thesis – requires large collections of heterogeneous data to be recorded, integrated, analyzed and resimulated. To support the researcher in these tasks, we developed the Interactive Augmented Data Explorer (IADE). IADE is an innovative tool for research on multimodal interaction based on virtual reality technology. It allows researchers to literally immerse into multimodal data and interactively explore them in real-time and in virtual space. With IADE we have also extended established approaches for scientific visualization of linguistic data to 3D, which previously existed only for 2D methods of analysis (e.g. video recordings or computer screen experiments). By this means, we extended Mc-Neill's 2D depiction of the gesture space to gesture space volumes expanding in time and space. Similarly, we created attention volumes, a new way to visualize the distribution of attention in 3D environments.},

In this paper, we show it can be used within a grounded CCGsemantic parsing approach that learns a joint model of meaning and context for interpreting and executing natural language instructions, using various types of weak supervision. The joint nature provides crucial benefits by allowing situated cues, such as the set of visible objects, to di- rectly influence learning. It also enables algo- rithms that learn while executing instructions, for example by trying to replicate human ac- tions.

A recent line of research has focused on building generative models from unaligned semantic representations, using expectation-maximisation techniques to align semantic concepts. This paper presents an efficient, simple technique that parses a semantic tree by recursively calling discriminative semantic classification models. Results show that it outperforms methods based on the Hidden Vector State model and Markov Logic Networks, while performance is close to more complex grammar induction techniques. We also show that our method is robust to speech recognition errors, by improving over a handcrafted parser previously used for dialogue data collection.},

@article{Clark1986,
abstract = {In conversation, speakers and addressees work together in the making of a definite reference. In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {This paper describes a spatial language understanding system based on a lexicon of words defined in terms of spatial rou- tines. A spatial routine is a script composed from a set of primitive operations on sensor data, analogous to Ullman's visual routines. We hypothesize that a set of primitives that underlie spatial language could be used to succinctly express themeaning of spatial terms in away that can be used to inter- pret natural language commands. This hypothesis is tested by using spatial routines to build a natural language interface to a real-time strategy game, in which a player controls an army of units in a battle. Spatial routines are used as a top down controlmechanismfor the system, providing amapping from natural language commands to system behavior. Although the current implementation has significant limitations as re- vealed in an initial evaluation, we believe that the concept of spatial routines holds promise as a way to ground spatial language semantics in terms of embodied sensory-motor in- teraction.},

Unfortunately, prior work has focused largely on deterministic incremental decision making, rendering system behaviour less flexible and adaptive than is desirable. We present a novel approach to incremental decision making that is based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to achieve an interactive optimisation of Information Presentation (IP) strategies, allowing the system to generate and comprehend backchannels and barge-ins, by employing the recent psycholinguistic hypothesis of information density (ID) (Jaeger, 2010).

The experiments show that unrestricted non-projective parsing gives a significant improvement in accuracy, compared to a strictly projective baseline, with up to 35{\%} error reduction, leading to state-of-the-art results for the given data sets.

abstract = {Parsing algorithms that process the input from left to right and construct a single derivation have often been considered inadequate for natural language parsing because of the massive ambiguity typically found in natural language grammars. Nevertheless, it has been shown that such algorithms, combined with treebank-induced classifiers, can be used to build highly accurate disambiguating parsers, in particular for dependency-based syntactic representations. In this article, we first present a general framework for describing and analyzing algorithms for deterministic incremental dependency parsing, formalized as transition systems. We then describe and analyze two families of such algorithms: stack-based and list-based algorithms. In the former family, which is restricted to projective dependency structures, we describe an arc-eager and an arc-standard variant; in the latter family, we present a projective and a non-projective variant. For each of the four algorithms, we give proofs of correctness and complexity. In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation of all algorithms in combination with SVM classifiers for predicting the next parsing action, using data from thirteen languages. We show that all four algorithms give competitive accuracy, although the non-projective list-based algorithm generally outperforms the projective algorithms for languages with a non-negligible proportion of non-projective constructions. However, the projective algorithms often produce comparable results when combined with the technique known as pseudo-projective parsing. The linear time complexity of the stack-based algorithms gives them an advantage with respect to efficiency both in learning and in parsing, but the projective list-based algorithm turns out to be equally efficient in practice. Moreover, when the projective algorithms are used to implement pseudo-projective parsing, they sometimes become less efficient in parsing (but not in learning) than the non-projective list-based algorithm. Although most of the algorithms have been partially described in the literature before, this is the first comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the algorithms within a unified framework.},

Con- verging evidence shows that human un- derstanding operates incrementally and makes use of multiple sources of infor- mation during the parsing process, in- cluding traditionally “later” aspects such as pragmatics. We describe a spoken dia- logue system that understands language incrementally, gives visual feedback on possible referents during the course of the user's utterance, and allows for over- lapping speech and actions. We present findings from an empirical study showing that the resulting dialogue system is faster overall than its nonincremental counterpart. Furthermore, the incremental system is preferred to its counterpart – beyond what is accounted for by factors such as speed and accuracy. These results are the first to indicate, from a controlled user study, that successful incremental understanding systems will improve both performance and usability.},

abstract = {The benefit of tracking a probability distribution over mul-tiple dialogue states has been demonstrated in the literature. However, the dialogue state in past work has been limited to a small number of variables, and growing the number of vari-ables in the dialogue state prevents the probability distribution from being updated in real-time. This paper shows how the number of variables composing the dialogue state can be in-creased while maintaining response times suitable for a spo-ken dialogue system. Rather than performing exact inference using the joint distribution over all variables, a particle filter is employed to compute an approximate update. Dialogue states (particles) are sampled, weighted by their agreement with the speech recognition results, and marginalized to produce a new distribution over each variable. Results on a spoken dialogue system for troubleshooting show that a relatively small num-ber of particles are required to achieve performance close to an exact update, enabling the dialogue system to run in real-time.},

abstract = {Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark (arXiv:1003.4394v1 [cs.CL]) developed a compositional model of meaning for distributional semantics, in which each word in a sentence has a meaning vector and the distributional meaning of the sentence is a function of the tensor products of the word vectors. Abstractly speaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical structure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. In this paper, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear meaning map, by constructing a corpus-based vector space for the type of sentence. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whereby meaning vectors of all sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure, live in the same vector space. Our proposed sentence space is the tensor product of two noun spaces, in which the basis vectors are pairs of words each augmented with a grammatical role. This enables us to compare meanings of sentences by simply taking the inner product of their vectors.},

abstract = {We propose a mathematical framework for a unification of the distributional theory of meaning in terms of vector space models, and a compositional theory for grammatical types, for which we rely on the algebra of Pregroups, introduced by Lambek. This mathematical framework enables us to compute the meaning of a well-typed sentence from the meanings of its constituents. Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are ‘lifted' to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes howthe information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence.

The agent exhibits adaptive behaviour by learning spatiallyaware dialogue actions while the user carries out the navigation task. To this end, we use Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with relational representations to efficiently optimize dialogue actions tightly-coupled with spatial ones, and Bayesian networks to model the user's beliefs of the navigation environment. Since these beliefs are continuously changing, we induce the agent's behaviour in real time. Experimental results, using simulation, are encouraging by showing efficient adaptation to the user's navigation knowledge, specifically to the generated route and the intermediate locations to negotiate with the user.

abstract = {This article addresses the problem of scalable optimization for spatially-aware dialogue systems. These kinds of systems must perceive, reason, and act about the spatial environment where they are embedded.We formulate the problem in terms of Semi-MarkovDecision Processes and propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to optimize subbehaviors rather than full behaviors.Because of the vast number of policies that are required to control the interaction in a dynamic environment (e.g., a dialogue system assisting a user to navigate in a building from one location to another), our learning approach is based on two stages: (a) the first stage learns low-level behavior, in advance; and (b) the second stage learns high-level behavior, in real time. For such a purpose we extend an existing algorithm in the literature of reinforcement learning in order to support reusable policies and therefore to perform fast learning. We argue that our learning approach makes the problem feasible, and we report on a novel reinforcement learning dialogue system that performs a joint optimization between dialogue and spatial behaviors.Our experiments, using simulated and real environments, are based on a text-based dialogue system for indoor navigation. Experimental results in a realistic environment reported an overall user satisfaction result of 89{\%}, which suggests that our proposed approach is attractive for its application in real interactions as it combines fast learning with adaptive and reasonable behavior.},

This paper begins with a brief description of the representational and computational aspects of the framework. Following that is a detailed description of GMTK's features, including a language for specifying structures and probability distributions, logarithmic space exact training and decoding procedures, the concept of switching parents, and a generalized EM training method which allows arbitrary sub-Gaussian parameter tying. Taken together, these features endow GMTK with a degree of expressiveness and functionality that significantly complements other publically available packages. GMTK was recently used in the 2001 Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop, and experimental results are described in detail both herein and in a companion paper.},

abstract = {In this paper, a multi-stage spoken language understanding system is presented. This stochastic module is for the first time based on a combination of dynamic Bayesian networks and conditional random field classifiers. The former generative models allow to derive basic concept sequences from the word sequences which are in turn augmented with modalities and hierarchical information by the latter discriminative models. To provide efficiently smoothed conditional probability estimates, factored language models with a generalized parallel backoff procedure are used as the network edge implementation. This framework allows a great flexibility in terms of probability representation facilitating the development of the stochastic levels (semantic and lexical) of the system. Experiments are carried out on the French MEDIA task (tourist information and hotel booking). The MEDIA 10k-utterance training corpus is conceptually rich (more than 80 basic concepts) and is provided with a manually segmented annotation. On this complex task, the proposed multi-stage system is shown to offer better performance than the MEDIA'05 evaluation campaign best system (H. Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2006)},

abstract = {This paper discusses semantic processing using the Hidden Vector State (HVS) model. The HVS model extends the basic discrete Markov model by encoding context in each state as a vector. State transitions are then factored into a stack shift operation similar to those of a push-down automaton followed by a push of a new preterminal semantic category label. The key feature of the model is that it can capture hierarchical structure without the use of treebank data for training. Experiments have been conducted in the travel domain using the relatively simple ATIS corpus and the more complex DARPA Communicator Task. The results show that the HVS model can be robustly trained from only minimally annotated corpus data. Furthermore, when measured by its ability to extract attribute-value pairs from natural language queries in the travel domain, the HVS model outperforms a conventional finite-state semantic tagger by 4.1{\%} in F-measure for ATIS and by 6.6{\%} in F-measure for Communicator, suggesting that the benefit of the HVS model's ability to encode context increases as the task becomes more complex. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent statistical approaches to this problem require additional resources (e.g. gazetteers, grammars, syntactic treebanks) which are expensive and time-consuming to produce and maintain. However, simple datasets annotated only with slot-values are commonly used in dialogue systems development, and are easy to collect, automatically annotate, and update. We show that it is possible to reach state-of-the-art performance using minimal additional resources, by using Markov logic networks (MLNs). We also show that performance can be further improved by exploiting long distance dependencies between slot-values. For example, by representing such features in MLNs, but without using a gazetteer, we outperform the hidden vector state (HVS) model of He and Young 2006 (1.26{\%} improvement, a 13{\%} error reduction).},

Specifically, SUC has an extremely sparse input feature space encompassing a very large number of lexical and semantic features. This is about a few thousand times larger than the feature space for acoustic modeling, yet with a much smaller number of training samples. Experimental results we obtained on a domain classification task for spoken language understanding demonstrate the effectiveness of DCNs.

abstract = {In this paper, we present a sentence simplification method and demonstrate its use to improve intent determination and slot filling tasks in spoken language understanding (SLU) systems. This research is motivated by the observation that, while current statistical SLU models usually perform accurately for simple, well-formed sentences, error rates increase for more complex, longer, more natural or spontaneous utterances. Furthermore, users familiar with web search usually formulate their information requests as a keyword search query, suggesting that frameworks which can handle both forms of inputs is required. We propose a dependency parsing-based sentence simplification approach that extracts a set of keywords from natural language sentences and uses those in addition to entire utterances for completing SLU tasks. We evaluated this approach using the well-studied ATIS corpus with manual and automatic transcriptions and observed significant error reductions for both intent determination (30{\%} relative) and slot filling (15{\%} relative) tasks over the state-of-the-art performances.},

abstract = {We have been developing a spoken language system to recognize and understand spontaneous speech. It is difficult for such systems to achieve good coverage of the lexicon and grammar that subjects might use because spontaneous speech often contains disfluencies and ungrammatical constructions. Our goal is to respond appropriately to input, even though coverage is not complete. The natural language component of our system is oriented toward the extraction of information relevant to a task, and seeks to directly optimize the correctness of the extracted information (and therefore the system response). We use a flexible frame-based parser, which parses as much of the input as possible. This approach leads both to high accuracy and robustness. We have implemented a version of this system for the Air Travel Information Service (ATIS) task, which is being used by several ARPA-funded sites to develop and evaluate speech understanding systems. Users are asked to perform a task that requires getting information from an Air Travel database. In this paper, we describe recent improvements in our system resulting from our efforts to improve the coverage given a limited amount of training data. These improvements address a number of problems including generating an adequate lexicon and grammar for the recognizer, generating and generalizing an appropriate grammar for the parser, and dealing with ambiguous parses.},

Since the form of natural language utterances differs stylistically from that of keyword search queries, to be able to match natural language utterances with related search queries, we perform a syntax-based transformation of the original utterances, after filtering out domain-independent salient phrases.

A challenging sub-task of intent detection is the identification of intent bearing phrases from a limited amount of training data, while maintaining the ability to generalize well. We present a new probabilistic topic model for jointly identifying semantic intents and common phrases in spoken language utterances. Our model jointly learns a set of intent dependent phrases and captures semantic intent clusters as distributions over these phrases based on a distance dependent sampling method. This sampling method uses proximity of words utterances when assigning words to latent topics. We evaluate our method on labeled utterances and present several examples of discovered semantic units. We demonstrate that our model outperforms standard topic models based on bag-of-words assumption.},

@article{Salvi2012,
abstract = {We address the problem of bootstrapping language acquisition for an artificial system similarly to what is observed in experiments with human infants. Our method works by associating meanings to words in manipulation tasks, as a robot interacts with objects and listens to verbal descriptions of the interactions. The model is based on an affordance network, i.e., a mapping between robot actions, robot perceptions, and the perceived effects of these actions upon objects. We extend the affordance model to incorporate spoken words, which allows us to ground the verbal symbols to the execution of actions and the perception of the environment. The model takes verbal descriptions of a task as the input and uses temporal co-occurrence to create links between speech utterances and the involved objects, actions, and effects. We show that the robot is able form useful word-to-meaning associations, even without considering grammatical structure in the learning process and in the presence of recognition errors. These word-to-meaning associations are embedded in the robot's own understanding of its actions. Thus, they can be directly used to instruct the robot to perform tasks and also allow to incorporate context in the speech recognition task. We believe that the encouraging results with our approach may afford robots with a capacity to acquire language descriptors in their operation's environment as well as to shed some light as to how this challenging process develops with human infants.},

abstract = {One of the first steps in building a spoken language understanding (SLU) module for dialogue systems is the extraction of flat concepts out of a given word sequence, usually provided by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In this paper, six different modeling approaches are investigated to tackle the task of concept tagging. These methods include classical, well-known generative and discriminative methods like Finite State Transducers (FSTs), Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs), or Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as techniques recently applied to natural language processing such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). Following a detailed description of the models, experimental and comparative results are presented on three corpora in different languages and with different complexity. The French MEDIA corpus has already been exploited during an evaluation campaign and so a direct comparison with existing benchmarks is possible. Recently collected Italian and Polish corpora are used to test the robustness and portability of the modeling approaches. For all tasks, manual transcriptions as well as ASR inputs are considered. Additionally to single systems, methods for system combination are investigated. The best performing model on all tasks is based on conditional random fields. On the MEDIA evaluation corpus, a concept error rate of 12.6{\%} could be achieved. Here, additionally to attribute names, attribute values have been extracted using a combination of a rule-based and a statistical approach. Applying system combination using weighted ROVER with all six systems, the concept error rate (CER) drops to 12.0{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Understanding this kind of linguistic input is challenging because diverse words and phrases must be mapped into structures that the robot can understand, and elements in those structures must be grounded in an uncertain environment. We present a system that follows natural language directions by extracting a sequence of spatial description clauses from the linguistic input and then infers the most probable path through the environment given only information about the environmental geometry and detected visible objects. We use a probabilistic graphical model that factors into three key components. The first component grounds landmark phrases such as ¿the computers¿ in the perceptual frame of the robot by exploiting co-occurrence statistics from a database of tagged images such as Flickr. Second, a spatial reasoning component judges how well spatial relations such as ¿past the computers¿ describe a path. Finally, verb phrases such as ¿turn right¿ are modeled according to the amount of change in orientation in the path. Our system follows 60{\%} of the directions in our corpus to within 15 meters of the true destination, significantly outperforming other approaches.},

Knowledge-based approaches, based on manually written grammars or inference rules, are often preferred as system designers can modify directly the SLU models in order to take into account such a modification in the service, even if no or very little related data has been collected. However as new examples are added to the annotated corpus, corpus-based methods can then be applied, replacing or in addition to the initial knowledge-based models. This paper describes an active learning scheme, based on an SLU criterion, which is used for automatically updating the SLU models of a deployed SDS. Two kind of SLU models are going to be compared: rule-based ones, used in the deployed system and consisting of several thousands of hand-crafted rules; corpus-based ones, based on the automatic learning of classifiers on an annotated corpus.},

abstract = {Recently, an ensemble speaker and speaking environment modeling (ESSEM) framework was proposed to enhance automatic speech recognition performance under adverse conditions. In the online phase of ESSEM, the prepared environment structure in the offline stage is transformed to a set of acoustic models for the target testing environment by using a mapping function. In the original ESSEM framework, the mapping function parameters are estimated based on a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. In this study, we propose to use a maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion to calculate the mapping function to avoid a possible over-fitting problem that can degrade the accuracy of environment characterization. For the MAP estimation, we also study two types of prior densities, namely, clustered prior and hierarchical prior, in this paper. On the Aurora-2 task using either type of prior densities, MAP-based ESSEM can achieve better performance than ML-based ESSEM, especially under low SNR conditions. When comparing to our best baseline results, the MAP-based ESSEM achieves a 14.97{\%} (5.41{\%} to 4.60{\%}) word error rate reduction in average at a signal to noise ratio of 0 dB to 20 dB over the three testing sets.},

Semantic frame structures are directly derived from word and basic concept sequences representing the users' utterances. A rule-based process provides a reference frame annotation of the speech training data. Then dynamic Bayesian networks are used to hypothesize frames from test data. The semantic frames used in this work are specialized on the task domain from the Berkeley FrameNet set. Experiments are reported on the French MEDIA dialog corpus. For all the data, the manual transcriptions and annotations at the word and concept levels are available. Tests are performed under 3 different conditions raising in difficulty wrt the errors in the word and concept sequence inputs. Three different stochastic models are compared and the results confirm the ability of the proposed probabilistic frameworks to carry out a reliable semantic frame annotation.},

abstract = {One of the main data resources used in many studies over the past two decades for spoken language understanding (SLU) research in spoken dialog systems is the airline travel information system (ATIS) corpus. Two primary tasks in SLU are intent determination (ID) and slot filling (SF). Recent studies reported error rates below 5{\%} for both of these tasks employing discriminative machine learning techniques with the ATIS test set. While these low error rates may suggest that this task is close to being solved, further analysis reveals the continued utility of ATIS as a research corpus. In this paper, our goal is not experimenting with domain specific techniques or features which can help with the remaining SLU errors, but instead exploring methods to realize this utility via extensive error analysis. We conclude that even with such low error rates, ATIS test set still includes many unseen example categories and sequences, hence requires more data. Better yet, new annotated larger data sets from more complex tasks with realistic utterances can avoid over-tuning in terms of modeling and feature design. We believe that advancements in SLU can be achieved by having more naturally spoken data sets and employing more linguistically motivated features while preserving robustness due to speech recognition noise and variance due to natural language.},

@article{Gupta2006,
abstract = {Spoken language understanding (SLU) aims at extracting meaning from natural language speech. Over the past decade, a variety of practical goal-oriented spoken dialog systems have been built for limited domains. SLU in these systems ranges from understanding predetermined phrases through fixed grammars, extracting some predefined named entities, extracting users' intents for call classification, to combinations of users' intents and named entities. In this paper, we present the SLU system of VoiceTone{\&}reg; (a service provided by AT{\&}T where AT{\&}T develops, deploys and hosts spoken dialog applications for enterprise customers). The SLU system includes extracting both intents and the named entities from the users' utterances. For intent determination, we use statistical classifiers trained from labeled data, and for named entity extraction we use rule-based fixed grammars. The focus of our work is to exploit data and to use machine learning techniques to create scalable SLU systems which can be quickly deployed for new domains with minimal human intervention. These objectives are achieved by 1) using the predicate-argument representation of semantic content of an utterance; 2) extending statistical classifiers to seamlessly integrate hand crafted classification rules with the rules learned from data; and 3) developing an active learning framework to minimize the human labeling effort for quickly building the classifier models and adapting them to changes. We present an evaluation of this system using two deployed applications of VoiceTone{\&}reg;.},

We believe this challenge includes evoking and signaling aspects of long-term relationships such as rapport. For tutoring systems, this may additionally require knowing how relationships are signaled among non-adult users. We therefore investigate conversational strategies used by teenagers in peer tutoring dialogues, and how these strategies function differently among friends or strangers. In particular, we use annotated and automatically extracted linguistic devices to predict impoliteness and positivity in the next turn. To take into account the sparse nature of these features in real data we use models including Lasso, ridge estimator, and elastic net. We evaluate the predictive power of our models under various settings, and compare our sparse models with standard non-sparse solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that our models are more accurate than non-sparse models quantitatively, and that teens use unexpected kinds of language to do relationship work such as signaling rapport, but friends and strangers, tutors and tutees, carry out this work in quite different ways from one another.},

One central limitation is that the state space of such models grows exponentially with the problem size, which makes parameter estimation increasingly difficult, especially for domains where only limited training data is available. In this paper, we show how to capture the underlying structure of a dialogue domain in terms of probabilistic rules operating on the dialogue state. The probabilistic rules are associated with a small, compact set of parameters that can be directly estimated from data. We argue that the introduction of this abstraction mechanism yields probabilistic models that are easier to learn and generalise bet- ter than their unstructured counterparts. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of such an approach learning a dialogue policy for a human-robot interaction domain based on a Wizard-of-Oz data set.},

We construct a moderate-sized corpus for the investigation of intra-sentential relations and propose models to label the relation structure. A learning based model is evaluated with various features. Experimental results show our model achieves accuracies of 81.63{\%} in the task of relation labeling and 74.8{\%} in the task of relation structure prediction.},

Also desirable would be the abil-ity to handle repairs and other modifications to exist-ing instructions. To this end, we collected a corpus of spoken instructions (and modified instructions) produced by subjects provided with an origin and a destination. We found that instructions could be classified into four categories, depending on their intent such as imperative, feedback, or meta com-ment. We asked a different set of subjects to fol-low these instructions to determine the usefulness and comprehensibility of individual instructions. Fi-nally, we constructed a semantic grammar and evalu-ated its coverage. To determine whether instruction-giving forms a predictable sub-language, we tested the grammar on three corpora collected by others and determined that this was largely the case. Our work suggests that predictable sub-languages may exist for well-defined tasks.},

Wizard-of-Oz variations, human-human data manipulation, and micro-domains are discussed in this context, as is the use of third-party reviewers to get a measure of the degree of human-likeness. We also present the two-way mimicry target, a model for measuring how well a human-computer dialogue mimics or replicates some aspect of human-human dialogue, including human flaws and inconsistencies. Although we have added a measure of innovation, none of the techniques is new in its entirety. Taken together and described from a human-likeness perspective, however, they form a set of tools that may widen the path towards human-like spoken dialogue systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present techniques for the incremental interpretation and prediction of utterance meaning in dialogue systems. These techniques open possibilities for systems to initiate responsive overlap be-haviors during user speech, such as interrupting, acknowledging, or completing a user's utterance while it is still in progress. In an implemented system, we show that relatively high accuracy can be achieved in understanding of spontaneous utterances before utterances are completed. Further, we present a method for determining when a system has reached a point of maximal understanding of an ongoing user utterance, and show that this determination can be made with high precision. Finally, we discuss a prototype implementation that shows how systems can use these abilities to strategically initiate system completions of user utterances. More broadly, this framework facili-tates the implementation of a range of overlap behaviors that are common in human dialogue, but have been largely absent in dialogue systems.},

abstract = {Conversational systems play an important role in scenarios without a keyboard, e.g., talking to a robot. Communication in human-robot interaction (HRI) ultimately involves a combination of verbal and non-verbal inputs and outputs. HRI systems must process verbal and non-verbal observations and execute verbal and non-verbal actions in parallel, to interpret and produce synchronized behaviours. The development of such systems involves the integration of potentially many components and ensuring a complex interaction and synchronization between them. Most work in spoken dialogue system development uses pipeline architectures. Some exceptions are [1, 17], which execute system components in parallel (weakly-coupled or tightly-coupled architectures). The latter are more promising for building adaptive systems, which is one of the goals of contemporary research systems. In this paper we present an event-based approach for integrating a conversational HRI system. This approach has been instantiated using the Urbi middleware [6] on a Nao robot, used as a testbed for investigating child-robot interaction in the ALIZ-E project. We focus on the implementation for two scenarios: an imitation game of arm movements and a quiz game.},

abstract = {As interactive voice response systems become more prevalent and provide increasingly more complex functionality, it becomes clear that the challenges facing such systems are not solely in their synthesis and recognition capabilities. Issues such as the coordination of turn exchanges between system and user also play an important role in system usability. In particular, both systems and users have difficulty determining when the other is taking or relinquishing the turn. In this paper, we seek to identify turn-taking cues correlated with human-human turn exchanges which are automatically computable. We compare the presence of potential prosodic, acoustic, and lexico-syntactic turn-yielding cues in prosodic phrases preceding turn changes (smooth switches) vs. turn retentions (holds) vs. backchannels in the Columbia Games Corpus, a large corpus of task-oriented dialogues, to determine which features reliably distinguish between these three. We identify seven turn-yielding cues, all of which can be extracted automatically, for future use in turn generation and recognition in interactive voice response (IVR) systems. Testing Duncan's (1972) hypothesis that these turn-yielding cues are linearly correlated with the occurrence of turn-taking attempts, we further demonstrate that, the greater the number of turn-yielding cues that are present, the greater the likelihood that a turn change will occur. We also identify six cues that precede backchannels, which will also be useful for IVR backchannel generation and recognition; these cues correlate with backchannel occurrence in a quadratic manner. We find similar results for overlapping and for non-overlapping speech. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Dialogue systems can be modeled effectively using POMDPs, achieving improvements in robustness. However, past research on POMDPs-based dialogue system assumes that the model parameters are known. This limitation can be addressed through model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning, which offers a rich framework for simultaneous learning and planning. However, due to the high complexity of the framework, a major challenge is to scale up these algorithms for complex dialogue systems. In this work, we show that by exploiting certain known components of the system, such as knowledge of symmetrical properties, and using an approximate online planning algorithm, we are able to apply Bayesian RL on a realistic spoken dialogue system domain.},

The model performs at least as well as an existing multi-port model on perplexity over subsequent speech activity.

@article{Yang2011,
abstract = {In this article we focus on human-human multi-tasking dialogues, in which pairs of conversants, using speech, work on an ongoing task while occasionally completing real-time tasks. The ongoing task is a poker game in which conversants need to assemble a poker hand, and the real-time task is a picture game in which conversants need to find out whether they have a certain picture on their displays. We employ empirical corpus studies and machine learning experiments to understand the mechanisms that people use in managing these complex interactions. First, we examine task interruptions: switching from the ongoing task to a real-time task. We find that generally conversants tend to interrupt at a less disruptive context in the ongoing task when possible. We also find that the discourse markers oh and wait occur in initiating a task interruption twice as often as in the conversation of the ongoing task. Pitch is also found to be statistically correlated with task interruptions; in fact, the more disruptive the task interruption, the higher the pitch. Second, we examine task resumptions: returning to the ongoing task after completing an interrupting real-time task. We find that conversants might simply resume the conversation where they left off, but sometimes they repeat the last utterance or summarize the critical information that was exchanged before the interruption. Third, we apply machine learning to determine how well task interruptions can be recognized automatically and to investigate the usefulness of the cues that we find in the corpus studies. We find that discourse context, pitch, and the discourse markers oh and wait are important features to reliably recognize task interruptions; and with non-lexical features one can improve the performance of recognizing task interruptions with more than a 50{\%} relative error reduction over a baseline. Finally, we discuss the implication of our findings for building a speech interface that supports multi-tasking dialogue. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Speaking using unconstrained natural language is an intuitive and flexible way for humans to interact with robots. Understanding this kind of linguistic input is challenging because diverse words and phrases must be mapped into structures that the robot can understand, and elements in those structures must be grounded in an uncertain environment. We present a system that follows natural language directions by extracting a sequence of spatial description clauses from the linguistic input and then infers the most probable path through the environment given only information about the environmental geometry and detected visible objects. We use a probabilistic graphical model that factors into three key components. The first component grounds landmark phrases such as ¿the computers¿ in the perceptual frame of the robot by exploiting co-occurrence statistics from a database of tagged images such as Flickr. Second, a spatial reasoning component judges how well spatial relations such as ¿past the computers¿ describe a path. Finally, verb phrases such as ¿turn right¿ are modeled according to the amount of change in orientation in the path. Our system follows 60{\%} of the directions in our corpus to within 15 meters of the true destination, significantly outperforming other approaches.},

abstract = {We have developed components of an automated system that understands and follows navigational instructions. The system has prior knowledge of the geometry and landmarks of specific maps. This knowledge is exploited to infer complex paths through maps based on natural language descriptions. The approach is based on an analysis of verbal commands in terms of elementary semantic units that are composed to generate a probability distribution over possible spatial paths in a map. An integration mechanism based on dynamic programming guides this language-to-path translation process, ensuring that resulting paths satisfy continuity and smoothness criteria. In the current implementation, parsing of text into semantic units is performed manually. Composition and interpretation of semantic units into spatial paths is performed automatically. In the evaluations, we show that the system accurately predicts the speakers' intended meanings for a range of instructions. This paper provides building blocks for a complete system that, when combined with robust parsing technologies, could lead to a fully automatic spatial language interpretation system.},

The algorithm takes a self training approach driven by confidence estimation. Evaluated over Geoquery, a standard dataset for this task, our system achieved 66{\%} accuracy, compared to 80{\%} of its fully supervised counterpart, demonstrating the promise of unsupervised approaches for this task.},

@article{Hernault2010,
abstract = {Discourse structures have a central role in several computational tasks, such as question-answering or dialogue generation. In particular, the framework of the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) offers a sound formalism for hierarchical text organization. In this article, we present HILDA, an implemented discourse parser based on RST and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. SVM classifiers are trained and applied to discourse segmentation and relation labeling. By combining labeling with a greedy bottom-up tree building approach, we are able to create accurate discourse trees in linear time complexity. Importantly, our parser can parse entire texts, whereas the publicly available parser SPADE (Soricut and Marcu 2003) is limited to sentence level analysis. HILDA outperforms other discourse parsers for tree structure construction and discourse relation labeling. For the discourse parsing task, our system reaches 78.3{\%} of the performance level of human annotators. Compared to a state-of-the-art rule-based discourse parser, our system achieves an performance increase of 11.6{\%}.},

abstract = {There are many references that concern a specific aspect of speaker tracking. This paper focuses on the speaker modeling issue and proposes conditional random fields (CRF) for this purpose. CRF is a class of undirected graphical models for classifying sequential data. CRF has some interesting characteristics which have encouraged us to use this model in a speaker modeling and tracking task. The main concern of CRF model is its training. Known approaches for CRF training are prone to overfitting and unreliable convergence. To solve this problem, variational approaches are proposed in this paper. The main novelty of this paper is to adapt variational framework for CRF training. The resulted approach is evaluated on three different areas. First, the best CRF model configuration for speaker modeling is evaluated on text independent speaker verification. Next, the selected model is used in a speaker detection task, in which the models of the existing speakers in the conversation are known a priori. Then, the proposed CRF approach is compared with GMM in an online speaker tracking framework. The results show that the proposed CRF model is superior to GMM in speaker detection and tracking, due to its capability for sequence modeling and segmentation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Adell2012,
abstract = {Until now, speech synthesis has mainly involved reading-style speech. Today, however, text-to-speech systems must provide a variety of styles because users expect these interfaces to do more than just read information. If synthetic voices must be integrated into future technology, they must simulate the way people talk instead of the way people read. Existing knowledge about how disfluencies occur has made it possible to propose a general framework for synthesising disfluencies. We propose a model based on the definition of disfluency and the concept of underlying fluent sentences. The model incorporates the parameters of standard prosodic models for fluent speech with local modifications of prosodic parameters near the interruption point. The constituents of the local models for filled pauses are derived from the analysis corpus, and constituent's prosodic parameters are predicted via linear regression analysis. We also discuss the implementation details of the model when used in a real speech synthesis system. Objective and perceptual evaluations showed that the proposed models outperformed the baseline model. Perceptual evaluations of the system showed that it is possible to synthesise filled pauses without decreasing the overall naturalness of the system, and users stated that the speech produced is even more natural than the one produced without filled pauses. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

With this idea as inspiration, we examine a number of prosodic and timing features as potential sources of information on what words the speaker is likely to say next. In spontaneous dialog we find that word probabilities do vary with such features. Using perplexity as the metric, the most informative of these included recent speaking rate, volume, and pitch, and time until end of utterance. Using simple combinations of such features to augment trigram language models gave up to a 8.4{\%} perplexity benefit on the Switchboard corpus, and up to a 1.0{\%} relative reduction in word error rate (0.3{\%} absolute) on the Verbmobil II corpus. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we show that synthetic voices built with HMM-based speech synthesis techniques from conversational speech data, preserved segmental and prosodic characteristics of frequent conversational speech phenomena. An analysis of an evaluation investigating the perception of quality and speaking style of HMM-based voices confirms that speech with conversational characteristics are instrumental for listeners to perceive successful integration of conversational speech phenomena in synthetic speech. The achieved synthetic speech quality provides an encouraging start for the continued use of conversational speech in HMM-based speech synthesis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Jaywant2012,
abstract = {Everyday communication involves processing nonverbal emotional cues from auditory and visual stimuli. To characterize whether emotional meanings are processed with category-specificity from speech prosody and facial expressions, we employed a cross-modal priming task (the Facial Affect Decision Task; Pell, 2005a) using emotional stimuli with the same valence but that differed by emotion category. After listening to angry, sad, disgusted, or neutral vocal primes, subjects rendered a facial affect decision about an emotionally congruent or incongruent face target. Our results revealed that participants made fewer errors when judging face targets that conveyed the same emotion as the vocal prime, and responded significantly faster for most emotions (anger and sadness). Surprisingly, participants responded slower when the prime and target both conveyed disgust, perhaps due to attention biases for disgust-related stimuli. Our findings suggest that vocal emotional expressions with similar valence are processed with category specificity, and that discrete emotion knowledge implicitly affects the processing of emotional faces between sensory modalities. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Entrainment, the phenomenon of dialogue partners becoming more similar to each other, is widely believed to be crucial to conversation quality and suc- cess.

As our learning approach, we extend Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) as Feature LSA (FLSA), and combine FLSA with the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. FLSA adds richer linguistic features to LSA, which only uses words. The k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm obtains its best results when applied to the reduced semantic spaces generated by FLSA. Empirically, our results are better than previously published results on two different corpora, MapTask and CallHome Spanish. Linguistically, we confirm and extend previous observations that the hierarchical dialogue structure encoded via the notion of game is of primary importance for dialogue act recognition.},

The questions addressed in this study are 1) whether deictic gestures are substitutable for deictic expressions, and 2) whether deictic gestures establish joint attention. An eye tracking experiment investigated the effect of referring expressions and gestures on various aspects of attention. Results indicated that deictic gestures substitute for location descriptions. Furthermore, the manipulation of the synchrony between gesture and speech showed that hearers benefit from focusing of visual attention.},

@article{Skantze2005,
abstract = {In this study, an explorative experiment was conducted in which subjects were asked to give route directions to each other in a simulated campus (similar to Map Task). In order to elicit error handling strategies, a speech recogniser was used to corrupt the speech in one direction. This way, data could be collected on how the subjects might recover from speech recognition errors. This method for studying error handling has the advantages that the level of understanding is transparent to the analyser, and the errors that occur are similar to errors in spoken dialogue systems. The results show that when subjects face speech recognition problems, a common strategy is to ask task-related questions that confirm their hypothesis about the situation instead of signalling non-understanding. Compared to other strategies, such as asking for a repetition, this strategy leads to better understanding of subsequent utterances, whereas signalling non-understanding leads to decreased experience of task success. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spoken dialog systems have difficulty selecting which action to take in a given situation because recognition and understanding errors are prevalent due to noise and unexpected inputs. To solve this problem, this paper presents a hybrid approach to improving robustness of the dialog manager by using agenda-based and example-based dialog modeling. This approach can exploit n-best hypotheses to determine the current dialog state in the dialog manager and keep track of the dialog state using a discourse interpretation algorithm based on an agenda graph and a focus stack. Given the agenda graph and multiple recognition hypotheses, the system can predict the next action to maximize multi-level score functions and trigger error recovery strategies to handle exceptional cases due to misunderstandings or unexpected focus shifts. The proposed method was tested by developing a spoken dialog system for a building guidance domain in an intelligent service robot. This system was then evaluated by simulated and real users. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively develop robust dialog management for spoken dialog systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Thomson2010,
abstract = {This paper describes a statistically motivated framework for performing real-time dialogue state updates and policy learning in a spoken dialogue system. The framework is based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which provides a well-founded, statistical model of spoken dialogue management. However, exact belief state updates in a POMDP model are computationally intractable so approximate methods must be used. This paper presents a tractable method based on the loopy belief propagation algorithm. Various simplifications are made, which improve the efficiency significantly compared to the original algorithm as well as compared to other POMDP-based dialogue state updating approaches. A second contribution of this paper is a method for learning in spoken dialogue systems which uses a component-based policy with the episodic Natural Actor Critic algorithm. The framework proposed in this paper was tested on both simulations and in a user trial. Both indicated that using Bayesian updates of the dialogue state significantly outperforms traditional definitions of the dialogue state. Policy learning worked effectively and the learned policy outperformed all others on simulations. In user trials the learned policy was also competitive, although its optimality was less conclusive. Overall, the Bayesian update of dialogue state framework was shown to be a feasible and effective approach to building real-world POMDP-based dialogue systems. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An important component of human-robot interaction is that people need to be able to instruct robots to move to other locations using naturally given directions. When giving directions, people often make mistakes such as labelling errors (e.g., left vs. right) and errors of omission (skipping important decision points in a sequence). Furthermore, people often use multiple levels of granularity in specifying directions, referring to locations using single object landmarks, multiple landmarks in a given location, or identifying large regions as a single location. The challenge is to identify the correct path to a destination from a sequence of noisy, possibly erroneous directions. In our work we cast this problem as probabilistic inference: given a set of directions, an agent should automatically find the path with the geometry and physical appearance to maximize the likelihood of those directions. We use a specific variant of a Markov Random Field (MRF) to represent our model, and gather multi-granularity representation information using existing large tagged datasets. On a dataset of route directions collected in a large third floor university building, we found that our algorithm correctly inferred the true final destination in 47 out of the 55 cases successfully followed by humans volunteers. These results suggest that our algorithm is performing well relative to human users. In the future this work will be included in a broader system for autonomously constructing environmental representations that support natural human-robot interaction for direction giving.},

Spatial language has occupied many researchers across diverse fields, such as linguistics, psychology, GIScience, architecture, and neuroscience. However, the vast majority of work in this area has examined spatial language in monologue situations, and often in highly artificial and restricted settings. Yet there is a growing recognition in the language research community that dialogue rather than monologue should be a starting point for language understanding. Hence, the current zeitgeist in both language research and robotics/AI demands an integrated examination of spatial language in dialogue settings. The present volume provides such integration for the first time and reports on the latest developments in this important field. Written in a way that will appeal to researchers across disciplines from graduate level upwards, the book sets the agenda for future research in spatial conceptualization and communication.},

abstract = { The field of speech recognition has clearly benefited from precisely defined testing conditions and objective performance measures such as word error rate. In the development and evaluation of new methods, the question arises whether the empirically observed difference in performance is due to a genuine advantage of one system over the other, or just an effect of chance. However, many publications still do not concern themselves with the statistical significance of the results reported. We present a bootstrap method for significance analysis which is, at the same time, intuitive, precise and and easy to use. Unlike some methods, we make no (possibly ill-founded) approximations and the results are immediately interpretable in terms of word error rate.},

This foundational text is the first comprehensive introduction to statistical natural language processing (NLP) to appear. The book contains all the theory and algorithms needed for building NLP tools. It provides broad but rigorous coverage of mathematical and linguistic foundations, as well as detailed discussion of statistical methods, allowing students and researchers to construct their own implementations. The book covers collocation finding, word sense disambiguation, probabilistic parsing, information retrieval, and other applications. More on this book},

The challenge is to build models that integrate multiple aspects of human lan- guage processing at the syntactic, seman- tic, and discourse level.

Current implementations of MLNs do not scale to large real-world data sets, which is preventing their wide-spread adoption. We present Tuffy that achieves scalability via three novel contributions: (1) a bottom-up approach to grounding that allows us to leverage the full power of the relational optimizer, (2) a novel hybrid architecture that allows us to perform AI-style local search efficiently using an RDBMS, and (3) a theoretical insight that shows when one can (exponentially) improve the efficiency of stochastic local search. We leverage (3) to build novel partitioning, loading, and parallel algorithms. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art implementations in both quality and speed on several publicly available datasets.},

abstract = {We propose a simple approach to combining first-order logic and probabilistic graphical models in a single representation. A Markov logic network (MLN) is a first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula (or clause). Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.},

abstract = {Introduction: While sentence comprehension has been reported to be defective in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), it is still unclear if this disorder reflects the presence of syntactic impairment, or may be attributed to other factors, such as executive or working memory dysfunction. In order to assess the status of syntactic knowledge in a group of patients belonging to the FTD spectrum, we investigated their ability to detect violations of Universal Grammar principles in a sentence judgement task. Methods: The group included four semantic dementia patients (SD), nine frontal variant of FTD patients (FvFTD), 15 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, and 11 corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS) patients. Their performance was compared to a group of 10 patients with mild probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and to 10 healthy volunteers. The patients underwent a standard aphasia test and a sentence comprehension test. The experimental study included five kinds of violations: semantic coherence (SC), verb-subject agreement (VSAgr), pronominalization involving clitic movement (ClM), interrogatives (WhS) and contrastive focus constructions (CFC). Results: The FTD patients performed within normal range in the aphasia test, and in the sentence comprehension test. Within the FTD subgroups, only patients with CBDS were significantly impaired in detecting three of the five kinds of violations. AD patients were also impaired in the detection of WhS and SC anomalies and in sentence comprehension. Discussion: The present findings indicate that, within the FTD spectrum, an impairment of syntactic knowledge can be found only in CBDS patients, even in the absence of clinical evidence of aphasia. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in conversational speech, i.e., speech-act-like units such as STATEMENT, Question, BACKCHANNEL, Agreement, Disagreement, and Apology. Our model detects and predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, collocational, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence. The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states. Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are modeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The statistical dialogue grammar is combined with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act. We develop a probabilistic integration of speech recognition with dialogue modeling, to improve both speech recognition and dialogue act classification accuracy. Models are trained and evaluated using a large hand-labeled database of 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous human-to-human telephone speech. We achieved good dialogue act labeling accuracy (65{\%} based on errorful, automatically recognized words and prosody, and 71{\%} based on word transcripts, compared to a chance baseline accuracy of 35{\%} and human accuracy of 84{\%}) and a small reduction in word recognition error.},

abstract = {Syntactically-enriched language models (parsers) constitute a promising component in applications such as machine translation and speech-recognition. To maintain a useful level of accuracy, existing parsers are non-incremental and must span a combinatorially growing space of possible structures as every input word is processed. This prohibits their incorporation into standard linear-time decoders. In this paper, we present an incremental, linear-time dependency parser based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and classification techniques. We devise a deterministic transform of CCG-bank canonical derivations into incremental ones, and train our parser on this data. We discover that a cascaded, incremental version provides an appealing balance between efficiency and accuracy.},

Our USP system transforms dependency trees into quasi-logical forms, recursively induces lambda forms from these, and clusters them to abstract away syntactic variations of the same meaning. The MAP semantic parse of a sentence is obtained by recursively assigning its parts to lambda-form clusters and composing them. We evaluate our approach by using it to extract a knowledge base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions.

abstract = {Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of rice shoot and root tonoplast-enriched and plasma membrane-enriched membrane fractions were carried out to look at tissue-specific expression, and to identify putative regulatory sites of membrane transport proteins. Around 90 unique membrane proteins were identified, which included primary and secondary transporters, ion channels and aquaporins. Primary H(+) pumps from the AHA family showed little isoform specificity in their tissue expression pattern, whereas specific isoforms of the Ca(2+) pump ECA/ACA family were expressed in root and shoot tissues. Several ABC transporters were detected, particularly from the MDR and PDR subfamilies, which often showed expression in either roots or shoots. Ammonium transporters were expressed in root, but not shoot, tissue. Large numbers of sugar transporters were expressed, particularly in green tissue. The occurrence of phosphorylation sites in rice transporters such as AMT1;1 and PIP2;6 agrees with those previously described in other species, pointing to conserved regulatory mechanisms. New phosphosites were found in many transporters, including H(+) pumps and H(+):cation antiporters, often at residues that are well conserved across gene families. Comparison of root and shoot tissue showed that phosphorylation of AMT1;1 and several further transporters may be tissue dependent.},

Moreover, contextual cueing can also adapt to environmental changes. For instance, when the target undergoes a predictable (i.e., learnable) location change, then contextual cueing remains effective even after the change, suggesting that a learned context is ?remapped? and adjusted to novel requirements. Here, we explored the stability of contextual remapping: Four experiments demonstrated that target location changes are only effectively remapped when both the initial and the future target positions remain predictable across the entire experiment. Otherwise, contextual remapping fails. In sum, this pattern of results suggests that multiple, predictable target locations can be associated with a given repeated context, allowing the flexible adaptation of previously learned contingencies to novel task demands.},

abstract = {Two experiments explored the mapping between language and mental representations of visual scenes. In both experiments, participants viewed, for example, a scene depicting a woman, a wine glass and bottle on the floor, an empty table, and various other objects. In Experiment 1, participants concurrently heard either 'The woman will put the glass on the table' or 'The woman is too lazy to put the glass on the table'. Subsequently, with the scene unchanged, participants heard that the woman 'will pick up the bottle, and pour the wine carefully into the glass.' Experiment 2 was identical except that the scene was removed before the onset of the spoken language. In both cases, eye movements after 'pour' (anticipating the glass) and at 'glass' reflected the language-determined position of the glass, as either on the floor, or moved onto the table, even though the concurrent (Experiment 1) or prior (Experiment 2) scene showed the glass in its unmoved position on the floor. Language-mediated eye movements thus reflect the real-time mapping of language onto dynamically updateable event-based representations of concurrently or previously seen objects (and their locations). ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Studies monitoring eye-movements in scenes containing entities have provided robust evidence for incremental reference resolution processes. This paper addresses the less studied question of whether depicted event scenes can affect processes of incremental thematic role-assignment. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants inspected agent-action-patient events while listening to German verb-second sentences with initial structural and role ambiguity. The experiments investigated the time course with which listeners could resolve this ambiguity by relating the verb to the depicted events. Such verb-mediated visual event information allowed early disambiguation on-line, as evidenced by anticipatory eye-movements to the appropriate agent/patient role filler. We replicated this finding while investigating the effects of intonation. Experiment 3 demonstrated that when the verb was sentence-final and thus did not establish early reference to the depicted events, linguistic cues alone enabled disambiguation before people encountered the verb. Our results reveal the on-line influence of depicted events on incremental thematic role-assignment and disambiguation of local structural and role ambiguity. In consequence, our findings require a notion of reference that includes actions and events in addition to entities (e.g. Semantics and Cognition, 1983), and argue for a theory of on-line sentence comprehension that exploits a rich inventory of semantic categories. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evalua- tions on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance benefits greatly from the lexical factoring.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of learning to map sentences to logical form, given training data consisting of natural language sentences paired with logical representations of their meaning. Previous approaches have been designed for particular natural languages or specific meaning representations; here we present a more general method. The approach induces a probabilistic CCG grammar that represents the meaning of individual words and defines how these meanings can be combined to analyze complete sentences. We use higher-order unification to define a hypothesis space containing all grammars consistent with the training data, and develop an online learning algorithm that efficiently searches this space while simultaneously es- timating the parameters of a log-linear parsing model. Experiments demonstrate high accuracy on benchmark data sets in four languages with two different meaning representations. 1},

abstract = {We propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for unsupervised semantic parsing. Following Poon and Domingos (2009), we consider a semantic parsing setting where the goal is to (1) decompose the syntactic dependency tree of a sentence into fragments, (2) assign each of these fragments to a cluster of semantically equivalent syntactic structures, and (3) predict predicate-argument relations between the fragments. We use hierarchical Pitman- Yor processes to model statistical dependencies between meaning representations of predicates and those of their arguments, as well as the clusters of their syntactic realizations. We develop a modification of the Metropolis- Hastings split-merge sampler, resulting in an efficient inference algorithm for the model. The method is experimentally evaluated by using the induced semantic representation for the question answering task in the biomedical domain.},

The model is applied to the task of mapping sentences to hierarchical representations of their underlying meaning. We introduce dynamic programming techniques for efficient training and decoding. In experiments, we demonstrate that the model, when coupled with a discriminative reranking technique, achieves state-of-the-art performance when tested on two publicly available corpora. The generative model degrades robustly when presented with instances that are different from those seen in training. This allows a notable improvement in recall compared to previous models.},

abstract = {Conversations provide rich opportunities for interactive, continuous learning. When some- thing goes wrong, a system can ask for clari- fication, rewording, or otherwise redirect the interaction to achieve its goals. In this pa- per, we present an approach for using con- versational interactions of this type to induce semantic parsers. We demonstrate learning without any explicit annotation of the mean- ings of user utterances. Instead, we model meaning with latent variables, and introduce a loss function to measure how well potential meanings match the conversation. This loss drives the overall learning approach, which in- duces a weighted CCG grammar that could be used to automatically bootstrap the semantic analysis component in a complete dialog sys- tem. Experiments on DARPA Communica- tor conversational logs demonstrate effective learning, despite requiring no explicit mean- ing annotations.},

We compare two types of statistical models for this task: a) local models, which predict a single class for an input; and b), sequential models, which align a sequence of classes to a sequence of input tokens. We show that, with some modifications, the first type of model can be improved and made to approximate the output of the second, even though the lat- ter is more informative. We show on two different data sets that both types of model achieve comparable performance (signifi- cantly better than a baseline), with the first type requiring simpler training data. Re- sults for the first type of model have been reported in the literature; we show that for our kind of data our more sophisticated variant of the model performs better.},
