\title{The Completed Autobiography of Biff Tannen}
\author{Beuford Tannen}




\begin{document}

  \maketitle

  \begin{abstract}
  My life has been a series of fortunate and unfortunate events. Mostly the latter. 

  \end{abstract}

  \section{The unfortunate birth of yours truly}
  \label{sec:into}
  
  My parents had a sense of humor.  They called me \biff.

  \section{They started calling me Biff}


  
  \section{They always sent me to the wood shed}
  \label{sec:birth}
  
  I always got in trouble. Refer to \cite{Kennington2014_coling}. 
  \subsection{I carved wood while I was in there}
  
  \subsubsection{I carved over 120 over the course of 3 years}
  
  As you can see in Figure \ref{fig:biff_the_man}, I am quite a dapper fellow.
  
  \paragraph{The first few} They weren't so good, but they looked like little people. 
  
  \paragraph{The next few} They got better over time

  \subsection{The one day they forgot I was in there}
  
  \section{The time I forgot who I was when I was where I was}
  \label{sec:forgot}
  
  As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:birth}, I was a trouble maker. Table \ref{tab:results} has a lot of numbers that are not at all related to my life.
  
  This follows from this spiffy paper: \cite{Schlangen2009}
